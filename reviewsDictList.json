    "text": "This is one of the best books I've ever read. A remarkable attempt by Jack London in dissecting a person's evolution of being as they happen upon the path of enlightenment. Martin Edin (M.E.--a hint at the author's identification with the hero?) is a roughneck sailor who is blinded and transformed by the inner and outer beauty of a woman he meets, but this is just the beginning. Looking into her eyes he caught, \"glimpses of the soul, and a glimpse of his own too.\" His former mode of being had come to an end.<br /><br />Throughout the story his journey is chronicled as an intellectual and moral advance that conducts him from the dark haunts of his former 'cave' of a life, and gives entrance into a world of truth and love that was too white hot in radiance for the sleepy bumps he used to call his eyes. He educates himself through a personal track of reading books (indiscriminately at first, but in time becoming more direct and intentional), and soon he soars above even his erudite peers in his apprehension of philosophy and scientific verities. \"And so you arise from mud, Martin Edin,...and you cleanse your eyes in a great brightness, thrusting your shoulders among the stars...and wresting highest heritage from all the powers that be.\"<br /><br />He mounts to a dizzying height of cultural development and cerebral prowess...yet he ultimately finds himself engulfed in loneliness and emptiness. He had opened the windows of the cramped quarters of his former existence, and having completed his trek of this new world he discovered, he finds that it is hermetically sealed from all outside life and anything that could possibly make him happy again. He had found truth, but lost love...and he finally wrestles with the decision about what to do with it all. His answer will shock you.",

It is one of those rare novels where I can identify closely with the main character. It is also one of those books where the reader is hooked from page one and entirely swept up in the the world London Creates. <br><br>Set in San Francisco, this semi-autobiographical novel is the story of Martin Eden, a sailor, who pursues ambitiously, dreams of bettering himself thru education and literary fame. With the help of the woman he falls in love with, he educates himself feverishly, reads everything he can get his hands on, and becomes a writer, hoping to gain the respectability sought by his girl. <br><br>Martin Eden soon learns that fame is a cruel mistress, that may never come to him. Martin works on his writing everyday, once he feels confident, he starts writing articles, essays and stories, sending them off to magazines and newspapers all across the country. He gets rejected by most of the magazines and newspapers he sent submissions to for quite a time until that cruel mistress comes knocking at his door. Lost love turns false and Martin pledges himself back towards the sea. <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1562396806i/27776697._SY540_.jpg\" alt=\"1\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Class is a major theme throughout <b>MARTIN EDEN</b>. Martin grew up as part of the working class and went on to become a sailor. A chance encounter brings him into contact with the Morris family. He feels uncomfortable, but inspired to better himself upon meeting them. Spurred on by his love for Ruth Morse, he embarks on a program of self-education, with the aim of becoming a famous writer and winning Ruth\u2019s hand in marriage. As his education progresses, Martin finds himself increasingly distanced from his working class background and surroundings. Eventually, when he finds that his education has far surpassed that of the class he looked up to, he finds himself more isolated than he ever felt possible. <br><br>I loved that London tied the theme of class not to material wealth, but to education, &amp; not to formal education as earned in degrees and diplomas, but to self improvement, &amp; experience as well as critical thinking &amp; analysis. Martin ultimately realizes this is actually a much higher education than the formal education enjoyed by the class he initially looked up to &amp; so desperately wanted to part of.<br><br>London's Prose is beautifully expressive. He was a true master of the English language. <b>MARTIN EDEN</b> is nearly perfect, and had left a lasting impression on me much the same as his <b>CALL OF THE WILD</b> did. <br><br>In the end, Martin does achieve the greatness he desires, but at a tremendous personal cost. In addition to becoming an educated person, and the toast of the town, Martin is a man of honor. He makes it his life's work to lift others up from poverty and dispair, and aids his friends and family, lifting them up to a better life in a way that no one offered to him when he was down. Martin Eden is truly a great and admirable man in many ways.<br><br>London is becoming one of my favorite writers. His work sticks with me in ways that most authors do not. The friendship between Martin Eden &amp; Russ Brissenden will always stay with me. I will be pondering <b>MARTIN EDEN</b> for years to come. <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1562396806i/27776696._SY540_.jpg\" alt=\"1\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">",

    "text": "<b>\"Of course it was beautiful; but there was something more than beauty in it, something more stingingly splendid which had made beauty its handmaiden.\"</b><br /><br />It is astounding how long it took for me to digest this book -and I say this in nothing but praise. Honestly, it's not like I'm sure the process is completed; I tend to believe the best books are the ones you never wholly digest, the ones that keep nagging at your mind for weeks, months, years, forever, too, if that is what it takes. And the best books are, also, the ones that, lo and behold, turn out to be but little mirrors of yourself - and more often than not, very much to your own dismay, shame, embarrassment and a tiny, timid ember of inner joy.<br />For me, <i>Martin Eden</i> was both.<br /><br />Meet young Martin Eden: a sailor, a commoner, an illiterate, a Mr Nobody, were it not for one thing: his boundless, painful sensitivity to beauty. Martin Eden can be described as naive in many (or possibly all) respects, but not this. He may not be able to give a cultured, sophisticated definition of what art is or is thought to be, but he just knows. He would say that he just knows it in his guts, though he wouldn't be able to elaborate further than that. He uses a metaphor that I took to heart immediately, probably because I find it not only strikingly to the point, but also poignant, smeared with sadness, and that was what stuck; it goes, <b>\"Dogs asleep in the sun often whined and barked, but they were unable to tell what they saw that made them whine and bark. He had often wondered what it was. And that was all he was, a dog asleep in the sun.\"</b> <br /><br />I think we're all, a little, like dogs asleep in the sun. <b>Martin Eden</b> aimed at the stars, <b>sought to express the inexpressible</b>, to strip humans of their own skin; but aren't we all a little like Martin Eden, like that slumbering dog, every minute of our life? I, for sure, feel like that <i>constantly</i>. I <i>constantly</i> feel like I've got tons of things to say, and never manage. And it's frustrating, so terribly frustrating. But I guess I learned to live with that, with our never-ending communicative stalling, with beating around the bush, with being <i>close</i> but never really <i>there</i>. Yes, I feel this is a good definition of what Martin Eden is: <b><i>close</i> but never really <i>there</i></b>. He is one of \"the legions of toil\", a \"hoodlum\", but he does not conform: he is too aware and awake, almost criminally so (there is a reason if his family, or part of it, almost disowns him). But even later, after he becomes a learned man, a famous writer, when he is finally allowed into the upper classes, he cannot ignore that he doesn't belong there either, as if he still hadn't got out the last bit of dirt from under his nails, or rather, as if the fact that <i>they</i> didn't have any, had never had any, could never, ever sit well with him. I know London didn't intend for him to be idolized, and I'm not idolizing it (obviously, or what I'm saying wouldn't have sense at all) but I see myself in him. I see myself and you and you and all, and I see myself projected in him as the minuscule Titan I am in my mind. Did London intend for <i>this</i>? I can't tell, but I certainly thank him for Martin Eden.<br /><br /><b>\"Saints in heaven -how could they be anything but fair and pure? No praise to them. But saints in slime -ah, that was the everlasting wonder! That was what made life worth while.\"</b><br /><br />I loved this book beyond words, and that is why I won't shame it further by attaching more of this senseless blabbering to it. It's sad and terrible and <b>asphyxiating</b> (in my mind it is <i>Martin Eden; or, The Cage</i>) and wide-ranging, and it's a masterpiece. So my request is: treat it kindly, even if it won't do the same to you. It simply doesn't know any better.",

    "text": "<i>The average review is more nauseating than cod-liver oil</i><br />(p323)<br /><br />***<br /><br />Jack London himself was a working class guy who got the audacious idea he wanted to be a writer, and by sheer Stakhanovite mind-over-matter vein-popping sleep-denying force he did so. His stand-in here, our Martin, does just the same. So here is the story of how a working class guy who drops all his aitches and does not know which fork to use to eat soup, and knocks over his girlfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s doilies with the lurchings of his sailorboy shoulders becomes the toast of literary America. This means that we get about 250 pages in which the same thing happens over and over again :<br /><br />Eating only three dried apricots per day and living in a single nasty room (\"those potatoes are rotting. Smell them, damn you, smell them\") with a bicycle suspended above his bed, Martin writes like a madman all day except for the hours he reads philosophy and poetry. He cuts his sleep down to four hours and resents every moment of unconsciousness. What is he writing? Love poetry, sociophilosophical essays, adventure stories, jokes, doggerel verse, you name it. Out it pours. He mails it all off to any one of 200 magazines and waits for the inevitable rejection letters, which arrive daily. Occasionally he sells a joke or a comic poem for two dollars. Now he can eat four dried apricots today! And he can get his suit out of the pawnshop so he can go and visit his posh girlfriend whose family regard him as something the cat dragged in. There, she swoons against his bulging thighs while giving him tips on grammar. Meanwhile he pounds Spencerian knowledge into her father, accusing him of every crime known to the bourgeois. You fatuous worm! He says. I will crush your kind with the heel of my boot, when I have redeemed it from the pawnshop. I will not even notice your bleeding corpse. My how amusing you are, Martin, says the father, meanwhile passing a note to the mother which says WE MUST KILL HIM TOMORROW. Oh Martin, your neck is like a bullock, sighs Ruth, the ethereal daughter. <br /><br />I admit this stuff gets a little bit tiresome <i>for 250 pages</i> but there\u2019s no denying the intensity of Jack\u2019s prose \u2013 his style is like a guy trapped in a cave desperately scrabbling at the wall of solid rock to reach daylight. It ain\u2019t pretty but it\u2019s intense, even if it does get more than a little eyerolling at times. It becomes very clear that Jack London thought that Jack London was a hell of a fellow, brawny and brainy (\"he was himself possessed of unusual brain vigor\") and handsome and charming the little birds right out of the sky. All girls swoon when he hoves into view. Oooh those bulging biceps. <br /><br />By the way, it has to be acknowledged that Jack London can come out with some of the worst sentences I\u2019ve read in a long time -<br /><br /><i>Her penetrative virginity exalted and disguised his own emotions, elevating his thoughts to a star-cool chastity<br /><br />\u2026summer lingered, fading and fainting among her hills, deepening the purple of her valleys, spinning a shroud of haze from waning powers and sated raptures, dying with the calm content of having lived and lived well.<br /><br />he appreciated the chance effects in words and phrases that came lightly and easily into his brain, and that later stood all tests of beauty and power and developed tremendous and incommunicable connotations.</i><br /><br /> But I must say I mostly loved this oddly compelling 500 page howl of anguish, for that\u2019s what it is. Jack London seems to be engaged in nothing more than self-love and aggrandizement for three quarters of Martin Eden, but then the direction of travel skews wildly and his hero reveals himself to be nothing more than an unpleasant kind of Nietzschean protofascist. Maybe Jack was at war with himself here. Something was up with Jack, for sure!<br /><br />Nobody liked this novel at the time, they wanted more dog stories. <br /><br />FURTHER READING :<br /><br /><i>Hunger</i> by Knut Hamsun and <i>New Grub Street</i> by George Gissing for guys starving themselves while they try to make it as a writer;<br /><br />and <i>Flowers for Algernon</i> by Daniel Keyes for another guy who starts off knowing nothing and very quickly appears to know like almost everything \u2013 Charlie is given a brain enhancing drug in that book but Martin, being Jack, doesn\u2019t need no drug, just three dried apricots a day. <br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />Get a Job by The Silhouettes<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysKhbaLyIFw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysKhb...</a><br /><br /><i>Their highest concept of right conduct, in his case, was to get a job.

    "text": "Note, Feb. 1, 2023: I've just edited this review to make a slight stylistic change in one sentence.<br /><br />In my combination review of <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/37677.The_Call_of_the_Wild___White_Fang\" title=\"The Call of the Wild / White Fang by Jack London\" rel=\"noopener\">The Call of the Wild/White Fang</a>, I made the comment (echoing a common critical axiom) that London. like some other Naturalists, was better at portraying animal characters than human ones. That judgment was based on a prior reading of five of his novels and a number of short stories. But after reading this novel, it's a judgment that has to be substantially revised; there are no animal characters at all here, and his job of characterization is outstanding. To be sure, the title character has a lot of London himself in his background and personality; but they aren't clones of each other, and the other important characters are vitally real as well.<br /><br />This is straightforward general fiction in the Realist-Naturalist tradition, set mostly in the author's native stamping grounds of San Francisco and Oakland, just across the bay. Published in 1908 (eight years before London died), it draws heavily on his own life experiences to tell the tale of a smart, but ignorant and uncultivated young seaman from a poor family, with no particularly noted talents except brawling and drinking. But when he rescues a wealthy lawyer's son from an altercation with some waterfront toughs, this leads to an introduction to their family --and a powerful crush on the beautiful and cultivated daughter of the house, Ruth. In turn, this propels him into a determination to better himself intellectually and socially, in order to make himself worthy of her, in her eyes and his own. This program takes the form of self-education through reading, especially in the public library and, eventually, a determination to become a writer himself. (Readers who know anything at all about London's life will recognize significant similarities, except that London had no Ruth-equivalent in his own life.) What results from this determination is the substance of the novel.<br /><br />London was one of the greatest storytellers of his generation, and he tells an always absorbing story here. But it's a well-tailored vehicle for serious ideas. Among the areas he explores are the real meaning of love (and its difference from infatuation, etc.); the need to be true to your own deepest aspirations and sense of yourself, not what others tell you to be; and the profound social injustice of that day, with its artificial class divisions and exploitation of the poor by the rich. (And the differences between 1908 and 2017, in those respects, aren't as great as we tell ourselves they are.) His portrayal of the superficiality and hypocrisy of the literary world is scathing (and also far from dated). And he also draws a painfully accurate picture of how few human beings actually use the minds they're endowed with to really look at the world around them with curiosity, to think for themselves and think about some things more basic and important than money and the minutia of daily living; and how many are content to go through life with no more curiosity or thought than cattle, and to distrust or resent anybody else who doesn't. (Despite our dissimilarities in many other ways, I could relate to Martin profoundly on that level, and it raked up childhood memories.)<br /><br />The most central thematic concern here, and probably THE central concern of London's own mind, however, is the inherent conflict between early 20th-century Socialism, with its cooperative ethic and its Utopian dream of conflict-free human brotherhood, vs. the supposedly \"scientifically-proven\" view of life as a Darwinist evolutionary project driven by eternal struggle between the fit and the unfit, in which the order of the day is every dog for himself, to drive evolution to the next rung of the ladder by pushing the inferior to the wall. London was a committed Socialist, and also a committed Darwinist --as with many wholly self-educated people, the first ideas that fell into his relatively fallow mind were embraced uncritically and took up unshakeable root-- but he faced the contradictions between the two, and was hag-ridden by the fear that the dream of Socialist Utopia might be doomed by Nature. Unlike London, Martin rejects Socialism and embraces the Social Darwinist individualism of Spencer and Nietszche --but he argues with Socialists and has a Socialist friend, and is haunted himself by natural human sympathy for the supposedly \"unfit\" and \"inferior\" peons of the class he was born into, which includes friends and family members.<br /><br />While the author has a good vocabulary, the diction here is simpler than that of the first half of the 19th-century --intelligent, but not stilted; any serious reader today could read it with no problem. The occasional passing use of the n-word, usually in the authorial narrative voice though from Martin's viewpoint, however, is a problem; these instances could be counted on the fingers of one hand, but they're still offensive. (The Darwinism of that day, which shaped both London and his protagonist, was of course openly racist; we can see echoes of this 30 years later in the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, who couldn't afford college and also substituted self-education by reading, as well --though his racial language isn't quite as insensitive as London's.) We have to, IMO, take a \"warts-and-all\" view of this novel as a product of its time and place. Readers who insist on having a happy, feel-good read, too, should be warned that this isn't one; I think it's an important and in significant ways a rewarding novel, but it's not an upbeat one. But with those caveats, I think a case could be made that while this isn't London's most popular novel, it is in many ways his masterpiece.",

    "text": "Okay, first I will discuss what I really did like about this book.<br /><br />Alright, when I first started reading it, I was very touched by the loving connection that the main character (Martin Eden) had with Ruth. It was very sweet, and at times it reminded me of my own relationship with my boyfriend, which made it endearing and all the more special to read. Jack London wrote of how Ruth would feel relieved from her studying at the university to see Martin, and how his presence rejuvenated her and gave her a better sense of being. I really really loved that. But, I was aware of the premise (Martin Eden: a guy struggling to become an accomplished and famous writer), so I quickly brushed away the idea of it being a love story, and I was totally cool with that! To be perfectly honest, though, the EARLY relationship between them was the only part of the book I was really fond of, which happened to be only like the first 100 pages.<br /><br />As the story progressed, Martin started to annoy me, and the plot became very redundant and, frankly, it bored me. I just..I think what Jack London lacks in this novel is the ability to make the reader (maybe I shouldn't generalize, so we'll just say me) feel any sort of connection with the characters. I did mention, however, that initially I did feel related/connected to Martin and Ruth's relationship, but later it felt very unfulfilled. <br /><br />It may seem like I'm just bashing this book..I promise you, it's not a bad read. It's just..well, I feel indifferent. I know what Jack London was trying to accomplish, and that's why I granted it 2 stars instead of 1. I get it. The struggling writer who works so hard and so long to achieve his dream, only to find that fame and fortune is not all it's cracked up to be. It's just...alright, I'm going to say it: it's cliche. Especially the ending. I don't know. I'm wasn't pleasantly surprised or anything; I knew it was coming. Blah.<br /><br />The writing is beautiful (another reason I couldn't bear to give it 1 star), and London is a genius at transfixing you with his words--but, that can only take you so far. The story was lacking, in my opinion. ",

If only it was covered in pine needles and pine trees and had the scent of pine wafting around it.

A woman who can really stand-up to him and someone the reader can truly get behind. So Papa Hemingway shits out Maria, a woman so badly written that the only thing I can remember about her is that her nipples point upwards. Possibly the most lamentable aspect of Maria's character is the fact that she was raped by a group of fascists, a tragic backstory that Hemingway glosses over into order to talk about what a <i>fantastic</i> rack she has.<br /><br />Hemingway's prose has always been an easy target. I would never, ever stoop so low. In fact, I will say thank god for Hemingway's prose! If <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> was actually written at a literacy level higher than that of a kindergartener then it would genuinely be unreadable. On top of that, Hemingway makes the frankly strange decision to self-censor all of the obscenities throughout the novel. 'What the fuck' becomes 'what the muck' and so on. Hilariously, he also often substitutes obscenities with the word 'obscenity'. So there are genuinely moments in this novel where characters say 'what the obscenity are you doing?' and 'go obscenity yourself'. <br /><br />My advice to all of you is to stay well away from this mess. There's nothing to see here folks. If you are interested in a book on the Spanish Civil War, read Orwell's <i>Homage to Catalonia</i>. If you want a good book about a bridge, and hey who doesn't, read Willa Cather's <i>Alexander's Bridge</i>. God, for whom the bell tolls? It tolls for me.",

i gotta say, i thought we were building toward something bigger.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 12</u><br />could this be...a wee bit....a hint of...sapphic???<br /><br />we have gotten roberto laid again and still not a single bridge has blown up. since i started this more bridges have collapsed in my day to day reality (1) than in this book (0). instead we have to deal with a man rationalizing himself into sleeping with a girl he knows he isn't going to marry. <br /><br />100 year old situationship alert.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 14</u><br />at this point i have accepted that the lack of action re: the bridge is a metaphor illustrating the futility and bureaucracy of war, and by this reasoning i am back on board. <br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 15</u><br />ah, friendship.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 16</u><br />the bridge is nowhere in sight but we do have people hitting each other. and i've gotta say, i'm feeling like i want to hit this pablo guy in the mouth myself.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 17</u><br />now we're talking about plans for AFTER the bridge?! it's like i'm the only one who cares about explosions at this point.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 18</u><br />i have been enjoying this read since i started, but today was the first day i was like...i can't wait to pick this up. and we haven't even blown up a bridge yet!<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 19</u><br />still no bridge, but we do have an incredible poetic description of the composite smell of death, made up of myriad images and scenes coming together into one horrible scent. so it's forgivable, still.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 20</u><br />classics are important because they teach you things about Eras of History. for example, now i know that people were just as horny in the 1940s as today. <br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 21</u><br />ACTION IS HAPPENING!!! <br /><br />i totally and 100% understand the point that hemingway is trying to make about how war crowds out your ability to love, or to even be human, but the extracurricular \"women aren't people\" type unthinking misogyny really adds to the vibe.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 22</u><br />man oh man all of these chapters have been so delightfully short. suddenly somehow doing 43 chapters in a 30 day month seems like an effortless treat.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 23</u><br />took like 3.5 days off to celebrate a multiday national event known as \"i saw boygenius live\" and i'm still ahead of schedule. thank you, past me.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 24</u><br />to be honest i just watched all quiet on the western front (great movie, highly recommend, most horrifying thing i've ever seen in my life) so all war content is just going to fail in comparison to that.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 25</u><br />i have roughly 2 brain cells to rub together today and i am spending absolutely all of their capacity on reading my daily chapter(s) anyway.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 26</u><br />and hemingway heard my plea from the future and granted me a chapter that's like 3.5 paragraphs long. i can't lose.<br /><br />AND it was really good. sheesh.<br /><br /><br /><u>CHAPTER 27</u><br />back to our regularly scheduled programming.

    "text": "Ok, before I commit the sacrilege of dismissing this \"classic,\" permit me to establish my Hemingway bona fides: I have read and loved just about everything else he wrote, and have taught Sun Also Rises, Farewell to Arms, and many short stories, and had a blast doing it. I've read Carlos Baker's classic bio, and numerous critical articles on H. I've made the pilgrimage to Key West and taken pictures of his study and the hordes of 6-toed cats. I dig Papa, ok?<br /><br />But I can not stand this book! I should say up front that I've never been able to tolerate it long enough to finish it -- twice. First time was nearly 30 years ago, and as a fairly recently discharged Army troop,I took up this book with much anticipation and excitement. I couldn't get past about half way through. I found the prose so incredibly flat and dull as to be soporific (and, yes, I fully understand and appreciate H's famous \"Iceberg Principle\" of writing -- \"the thing left unsaid\" etc). The problem wasn't the \"thing left unsaid;\" the problem was too many things said, and in a very boring fashion. How could a book with such a dramatic plot be so dull, I wondered in shock? It's all in the language, or lack thereof. I have a theory that great short story writers often don't make great, or even good, novelists, because the voice and style that works so well in the shorter genre just doesn't translate to the longer one (John Cheever, case in point; IB Singer, to a lesser extent). Now, of course, H. did write great novels; this just isn't one of them. Take away the language in H's novels, and what are you left with -- borderline juvenile adventures and fantasies, or at best, semi-journalistic accounts.<br /><br />Compare the opening of Bells with the opening of Farewell to Arms: be honest and tell me if you hear even one faint echo of the magical rhythm of that famous opening in Bells -- anywhere, not just the beginning? And the dialogue, sweet jesus, joseph and mary, I've heard corporate phone recordings with more intonation and human warmth.<br /><br />A few months ago, our book club selected this novel. At first, I kept my opinions to myself and hoped I would have a different response reading this time. I readily acknowledge that my reading tastes have evolved -- matured, I hope -- significantly over the years, and maybe I just had a tin ear 30 years ago. Not the case. I couldn't even get beyond the first 6 pgs this time. That flat voice was duller than ever! \"Waterboarding would be more tolerable than reading 400+ pages of this stuff,\" I thought. I've choked down some mediocre books before for the sake of fulfilling my civic duty as a long-standing member of our book club, but I couldn't do it this time.<br /><br />This is not to suggest that the rest of you are wrong. I have a dear friend who's read more great literature than I can remember, and he loves this book, and expresses great shock when I tell him how much I hate it. But there it is. ",

The world refers to it as the Spanish Civil War, but to the citizens of Spain it is called <b>The Civil War</b>. It was a war for control of the soul of a country. It was fought between the Republicans, who were democratically elected and the Nationalists, a Fascist group wanting to overthrow the government. Most people were not aware at the time, but really this Civil War was a precursor, a warming pan for World War Two. The Soviet Union and a coalition of other future allies who stayed behind the scenes provided help and advice for the Republicans. Germany and Italy provided support for the Nationalists. There were international brigades formed up of volunteers from all over the world who came to Spain to fight against fascism. <br><br>They lost. <br><br>Francisco Franco, leader of the Nationalists, was the dictator of Spain until his death in 1975. <br><br>Ernest Hemingway went to Spain as a war correspondent for the North American Newspaper Alliance and was hoping to find some great material for a book. The dialogue is written in an archaic style implying that it is the most correct translation from the Spanish. The thees and thous are distracting and certainly added some ponderousness to a book that was set in the 1930s not the 1630s. <br><br><a href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/HemingwaySpanishWar_zps196a4eb6.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1534871472i/26173002.jpg\" alt=\" photo HemingwaySpanishWar_zps196a4eb6.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a><br><b>Hemingway in Spain.</b><br><br>Robert Jordan is an American who has been trained to be a dynamiter. He joins a band of gypsy freedom fighters up in the hills of Sierra de Guadarrama with orders to blow a bridge that may or may not be important. The chances of survival are slender because they are too few and the timeline too tight. He meets Maria who has been saved by the band from the Fascists who had tortured and raped her. <br><br>He falls head over heels in love. <br><br><i>\u201cI loved you when I saw you today and I loved you always though I have never seen you before.\u201d</i> <br><br>It could be the added tension of facing certain death coupled with her very real vulnerability that made him protective and lustful for her. Their relationship quickly goes medieval with her begging him for ways to help him: shining his shoes, pouring him wine, mending his clothes, or fetching him something to eat. She is constantly insecure about her appearance because the Fascists had cut off her hair and she only had a stubble grown back. The relationship is built on the most shallow grounds. It is difficult to conceive that it would have survived a move back into a regular life. <br><br><b>\u201cBut did thee feel the earth move?\u201d </b><br><br>I\u2019m not sure if this is where the concept of sex being cosmic originated, but it certainly provided some eye rolling moments for this reader. Especially when the gypsy witch Pilar tells Maria that she will only feel the earth move three times in her lifetime. <br><br>Why three times?<br><br>It is not known, but Pilar is most certain it can only happen three times. <br><br><a href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/for-whom-the-bell-tolls_zps796f5c90.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1534871472i/26173001.jpg\" alt=\" photo for-whom-the-bell-tolls_zps796f5c90.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a><br><b>There is a 1943 movie starring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper.</b><br><br>Jordan\u2019s relationship with the rest of the band is one of uncertainty and shifting alliances. He certainly is stepping on the toes of the original leader Pablo who used to be a man of great courage, but had lost his desire to want to kill or be killed. He is considered a coward or in my opinion maybe he\u2019d just had his belly full of it. He commits an act of treason in an attempt to save the band, but decides in the final moment to come back and help. In some ways he is the most interesting character in the book. A man who is evolved past mindlessness and wants more reason for blowing a bridge or killing people than just to follow orders. <br><br>The best scene in the book is the death of a band of guerrillas who are lead by El Sordo. They are trapped on a hill by the Nationalists and it is some of the most compelling writing in the book as the action shifts between Jordan\u2019s band who want to help, but know it is suicide to help, and the band on the hill wondering if help will arrive. Courage is something Hemingway respects and cowardice is something he worries about. The potential of experiencing his own bout of cowardice or finding it in others is a theme of his life. <br><br>Jordan\u2019s father had committed suicide, an act of cowardice as far as Jordan was concerned. He is worried that he will be captured and would be forced to kill himself like his father. It puts into question his whole feelings about his father and the way he died. I found myself wincing as I was reading these passages seeing Hemingway\u2019s own mind so glaringly revealed. Hemingway's father killed himself, as did his sister and brother. The curse continued into another generation with the suicide of his granddaughter Margaux. If Hemingway felt the way Jordan did (I believe he did.) I do wonder if he finally forgave his own father when he became the mechanism of his own death or did he maybe blame his father for cursing the family with suicidal thoughts?<br><br><a href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/user/jkeeten/media/ErnestHemingway_zps88ac2cd4.jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1534871472i/26173004.jpg\" alt=\" photo ErnestHemingway_zps88ac2cd4.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a><br><b>Hemingway posing with his favorite shogun.

Rereading it now, at this point in my life was a struggle. The story is actually very simple, but this is a book that has fallen in a barrel of water and been bloated beyond recognition. Hemingway is famous for his concise sentences and for the precision of his plots, but in this novel he certainly moves away from both of those concepts. There is a wonderful short novel here hidden behind too much ink. The plot actually becomes tedious and repetitive. Words I thought I would never use to describe a Hemingway novel. I can\u2019t begin to convey how disappointed I felt.

    "text": "<b>\u201cIf we can win here, we can win everywhere...the world is a fine place and worth the fighting for, and I hate very much to leave it...\u201d</b><br />-\tErnest Hemingway, <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> <br /><br />One of my favorite subgenres of literature is the people-on-a-mission story. If you have a collection of disparate individuals, each with a specific set of skills, and if they have to do something really hard and dangerous, preferably involving the destruction of a bridge, I am absolutely <i>there</i>. I\u2019m not quite sure, but this affinity may have started when I first watched <i>The Bridge on the River Kwai</i> with my dad. Ever since, I have been a sucker for tales involving men and women who have a one-way ticket with destiny. <br /><br />Thus, it\u2019s no surprise that I loved Ernest Hemingway\u2019s <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>. Though positioned as a \u201cclassic,\u201d it is really just a gussied-up action-adventure novel about a fella trying to disrupt a chasm-spanning structure with a little well-placed trinitrotoluene. Adhering to the typical tropes, he even has time to fall in love, before his deadly rendezvous. <br /><br />The fella, in this case, is Robert Jordan, an American fighting against the Nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War. This understudied conflict \u2013 which began in 1936 \u2013 served as a prelude to the Second World War, and became a proxy for the competing ideologies of communism and fascism. As such, it drew journalists and volunteers from all over the world. One of those journalists was Hemingway himself, who went to Spain to cover the conflict, and developed a sympathy for the Republican cause. <br /><br />This sympathy is on full display in <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>, which begins with young Robert lying on his stomach, listening to the wind in the pines as he surveys the bridge that he is slated to destroy. To complete his task, Robert joins a group of partisans, meeting three central characters: Pablo, Pilar, and Maria.<br /><br />Pablo is the leader, but he is aging, selfish, and on the verge of betraying the Republic. Pilar is his wife, and the true leader of the band. Though Hemingway is not particularly known for his fully-realized female characters, Pilar steals every scene of which she is a part. Shrewd, mystical, and manipulative, she is the glue holding the band together, and also the conductor setting everything in motion. Finally, there is Marie, a beautiful young girl who was raped by the fascists and had her hair shorn off. Despite his lethal assignment, Robert finds time to fall in love with Maria, even as the clock ticktocks towards eternity. <br /><br />***<br /><br />Hemingway is an author whose reputation definitely precedes him. Even if you\u2019ve never read one of his novels, you\u2019ve probably seen his style parodied: the taut, terse prose; his this-then-that manner of storytelling; and his offbeat grammatical structures that make you think you are reading an English translation, rather than a book written in English. <br /><br />All those things \u2013 along with Hemingway\u2019s penchant for exploring men being men \u2013 is certainly on display here. But you also see that the \u201csimplicity\u201d with which he writes is deceptive. For instance, many of his short, punctual sentences are adding up to something, such as this breathlessly long passage of Robert and Maria spending some alone-time together: <br /><br /><blockquote>Then there was the smell of the heather crushed and the roughness of the bent stalks under her head and the sun bright on her closed eyes and all his life he would remember the curve of her throat with her head pushed back into the heather roots and her lips that moved smally and by themselves and the fluttering of the lashes on eyes tight closed against the sun and against everything, and for her everything was red, orange, gold-red, from the sun on the closed eyes, and it all was that color, all of it, the filling, the possessing, the having, all of that color, all in a blindness of that color. For him it was a dark passage which led to nowhere, then to nowhere, then again to nowhere, once again to nowhere, always and forever to nowhere, heavy on the elbows in the earth to nowhere, hung on all time always to unknowing nowhere, this time and again for always to nowhere, now not to be borne once again always and to nowhere, now beyond all bearing up, up, up and into nowhere, suddenly, scaldingly, holdingly all nowhere gone and time absolutely still and they were both there, time having stopped and he felt the earth move out and away from under them.</blockquote><br /><br />It is writing like this that puts <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> into a different realm. By way of plot, this could have been written by Jack Higgins or Alistair Maclean. Hemingway\u2019s undeniable talent gives this potboiler a high literary gloss. <br /><br />***<br /><br />Don\u2019t let that gloss fool you, though. This is a fun read. Of the Hemingway novels I\u2019ve read, this is the most purely enjoyable. It mixes together a lot of dependable elements, such as hopeless love; the debate over pragmatism versus principle; and some pretty solid action scenes, given the Hemingway treatment, as in the famous hilltop stand of the partisan El Sordo: <br /><br /><blockquote>When the shooting had started he had clapped [his] helmet on his head so hard it banged his head as though he had been hit with a casserole and, in the last lung-aching, leg-dead, mouth-dry, bullet-spatting, bullet-cracking, bullet-singing run up the final slope of the hill after his horse was killed, the helmet had seemed to weigh a great amount and to ring his bursting forehead with an iron band. But he had kept it. Now he dug with it in a steady, almost machinelike desperation. He had not yet been hit\u2026</blockquote> <br /><br />I appreciate imagery in my fiction. I like having scenes described. Hemingway does this as well as anyone. He puts you right there. <br /><br />***<br /><br />This is a book I first read when I was a freshman in college. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that this was not exactly the most clearheaded period of my life. My emotional lability was like a metronome on a ship in a hurricane. The highs were high, the lows were low. Every defeat was like Waterloo, and so was every victory. Each new love was like the world\u2019s first. It was in this mind-muddled context that I first discovered Robert, Maria, and Pilar, and their mission to de-bridge a gorge. I would be lying if I did not say that my fevered, volatile self firmly embraced Robert\u2019s romantic fatalism: <br /><br /><blockquote>[W]hen I am with Maria I love her so that I feel, literally, as though I would die and I never believed in that nor thought that it could happen. So if your life trades its seventy years for seventy hours I have that value now and I am lucky enough to know it. And if there is not any such thing as a long time, nor the rest of your lives, nor from now on, but there is only now, why then now is the thing to praise\u2026</blockquote> <br /><br />Of course, I am no longer in college, no longer that young, and \u2013 thankfully \u2013 at least a bit more stable, though that is relative. Thus, it was interesting to reassess <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> with emotions that are a bit less raging. I have long classed this among my all-time favorite books, but I\u2019m not certain that would be the case if I read this for the first time today. <br /><br />With that said, there is still a fundamental power in this novel that is undeniable. The cinematic quality of the set pieces still holds up. So does the way that Hemingway marvelously captures the tensions between youth and experience, between choosing causes and choosing people, between what is worth dying for, and for what is worth living.<br /><br />Also, there is a bridge that needs to be blown up, and that\u2019s the kind of saga that never goes out of style.",

    "text": "At some point in high school, I decided that I hated Ernest Hemingway. Was it the short story we read in English class? Was it the furniture collection named after him at Gabbert's? Something made me decide that Hemingway was a prick, and after that I dismissed him entirely.<br /><br />This book was beautiful. <br /><br />I don't even like books about war. (Case in point: I scanned half of <i>War and Peace</i>. I think which half is obvious.) But this book took five hundred pages to blow up a single bridge. There were tanks to count, grenades to gather, diagrams to be drawn and generals to contact. Somehow all of this managed to be completely enthralling to a reader whose eyes would otherwise glaze over at the mere mention of battalions. <br /><br />I have to admit, a big part of my interest in it was likely due to the whole \"American escapes America to live in caves and drink absinthe with the gypsies\" thing. Who doesn't want to fantasize about that? And sleeping on pine needles, and falling in love with the gypsy girl! YES.<br /><br />But mostly: I love how Hemingway writes his dialogue as though it were being directly translated. I love the slow sense of living, the feeling of being in the open air, the way you enter his main character's head through his stream of conscious ramblings. And I love that Robert Jordan is referred to as Robert Jordan throughout the entire book -- the way you refer to famous people, historical figures, the names you must commit to memory.",

Hemmingway was one of many artists that opposed Franco's repression of the Catalan Republic which was founded on Anarchist principles and crushed mercilessly by the right-wing Falangists with the full support of Hitler (while promised support for the Catalonians from Britain and France never materialized due to their failed strategy of Appeasement). This is the subject of Picasso's Guernica in Madrid's Reina Sophia museum - one of the most powerful pieces of art on the planet. In any case, it is against this fatalistic background (it was written in 1940, a few years after the annihilation of the movement), Hemmingway places an idealist American fighting for Catalonia and, well, things do not end well as one might surmise. It is a typically understated masterpiece of Hemmingway prose that can be read as a historical document about the failed revolution, a swan song for the pre-WWII idealism, or a precursor to the death and destruction of WWII to come, but nonetheless, it must be read as an essential anti-war text and an American masterpiece.<br><br>Robert Jordan is sent behind the fascist lines in the mountains near Segovia and there he joins forces with a band of guerrilla fighters and falls in love with Maria, a young girl who barely survived captivity by the fascists and was rescued by the band. There is Pablo and his wife Pilar, the de facto leaders, a gypsy Rafael, an older man Anselmo and a few other revolutionaries. Robert\u2019s mission to blow up a bridge over a deep gorge while the Republican army opens a new front in the war, hoping to conquer Segovia, is an ill-thought-out move and some disagreement in the group nearly leads to a split.<br><br>The book is Hemingway\u2019s longest and his protagonist Robert Jordan may be the closest to an autobiographical portrait as he also lost his father to a suicide and seems addicted to action and violence.<br><br>Don't miss my review of the Meyer biography of Hemingway: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1868069065\">https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...</a>",

    "text": "Just when I'd decided that Hemingway only ever wrote books about people getting drunk in cafes and thinking about how miserable they are, he surprises me and comes out with something like this. Naturally, the characters still get drunk and think about how miserable they are, but they do it while being guerrilla fighters in the Spanish Civil War, which makes it awesome. <br /><br />In <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/133518.The_Things_They_Carried\" title=\"The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien\" rel=\"noopener\">The Things They Carried</a>, Tim O'Brien writes that, \"If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie.\" I kept coming back to that quote as I read this book, because it proves that Robbins was absolutely right. <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> is not an uplifting story, and it's not moral. And when you're writing about a ragtag bunch of rebels fighting a fascist army, that's not easy to do. There are no good guys in this story, and no bad guys - not even the fascists. <br /><br />\"Good\" and \"Bad\" in this story isn't divided by such clear lines. Instead, the biggest enemy that the protagonist (I won't use the word \"hero\") Robert Jordan faces is within the rebel group itself - a lot of strong personalities are drawn together by this war, and throwing them all together and making them live in a cave maybe wasn't the best way to go about things. The result is a fascinating portrait of a small group of people under enormous pressure, all trying to do the right thing even as they question what the right thing really is. Even when you're fighting fascists, nothing is black and white. <br /><br />Another observation: having previously believed that Hemingway was incapable of writing compelling female characters, I am now forced to revise that opinion. There are only two women in this book, but they are both fully realized and compelling. Other reviewers found Maria one-dimensional, but I thought she was fascinating because of what was hinted at, but not revealed, about her. Her staggering understatement to describe her time as a prisoner of war - \"Things were done to me\" - is wonderful. She was tragic and sweet, and on a related note, Hemingway writes some surprisingly good sex scenes, so there's that. <br /><br />And Pilar. Holy crap. Probably one of the most well-done characters I've ever read, she's alternately the mother figure, the best friend, the confidante, and the villain. Pilar is my new spirit animal. <br /><br />A war story without heroes or villains, full of hollow victories and rage against the bureaucracy of war and what people under pressure can be forced to do, filled with some very good meditations on killing and war and love, and the importance of acting beyond personal gain. Well done, Mr. Hemingway. <br /><br />(I should also add that Campbell Scott, who read the audiobook, does a fantastic job - he makes the characters' voices different enough for you to tell them apart without difficulty, and his Robert Jordan voice is exactly how I imagine Hemingway sounded in real life. If you're considering reading this, I'd recommend tracking down the audio version)",

But when I got to the stage where I was dreading picking up the book as I was finding it so monotonous, I decided enough was enough--it was going back to the library from whence it came. <br /><br />The lengthy novel tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to a republican guerrilla unit during the Spanish Civil War. As a dynamiter, he is assigned to blow up a bridge during an attack on the city of Segovia.<br /><br />By the half-way point, he still hadn't blown up the bridge but was instead engaging in seemingly never-ending debate about why it needed blowing up, how to do it, whether or not everyone in his group was in favour of the destruction .....the list could go on but I will spare you. I turned each page wondering if it would be the culmination of 250 pages of planning but sadly it was not to be.

Like \"Anna Karenina,\" \"Crime and Punishment,\" or \"Native Son,\" its one of those cornerstones of literature that utterly justified its spot in the cannon. The characters were perfectly wrought, and achingly human, with each life being so significant and yet miniscule in the face of war.<br /><br />It's true that Hemingway can't write a real woman to save his life (Pilar is fantastic, but really he writes her as a man), and Maria's adoration of Robert gets tiresome, but really that's the only false note in this entire epic. For everyone who complains about the stilted dialogue, the dialogue is one of the strokes of absolute genius. Yes, it sounds unnatural, but that's because Hemingway is perfectly capturing how people who don't speak the same native language communicate -- the dialogue is in actually in Spanish between the American Robert and the Spanish guerillas.

However, his standard sexism toward the female characters still applied. Here are a few more things I didn't like about the book:<br />*Did he really have to write \"rope-soled shoes\" every time he mentioned their footwear or even their feet?<br />*The dialogue was the standard stiff Hemingway dialogue, but somehow it seemed even more wooden.<br />*Every Spanish character goes by a first name or a nickname. Not Robert Jordan, the American. He is Robert Jordan (full name) at every mention.<br />*Robert Jordan finds the love of his life in about 17 minutes. Leave it to the Papa to churn out a beautiful and realistic love story.<br />*Every character is so up front with every emotion and the writing was so repetitive (here is my dramatic interpretation): <i>He was frightened. \"I say these things because I am frightened,\" said the frightened man.</i> or <i>She felt herself falling in love with the Hemingway-like main character. \"I feel myself falling in love with you,\" she told him. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"You are falling in love with me.\"</i><br /><br />I liked a few things about this one: the power struggles, the descriptions of war strategies at various levels of command...

The language <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/author/show/1455.Ernest_Hemingway\" title=\"Ernest Hemingway\" rel=\"noopener\">Ernest Hemingway</a> uses is sparse, with weird repetitions, first of which is that the name of protagonist Robert Jordan is being mentioned every page around 3 times.

However in for instance chapter 10 Hemingway shows his brilliance with a harrowing tale on the uprising in a small village and what war between neighbors actually means, with executions and mass killings.<br /><br />Why could\u2019t Pilar narrate the book, I started to think more often as the book progressed: her stories are actually interesting and touching, and she is a very interesting character as even the narrator himself notes:<br /><i>\u201cYou are a very hard woman,\u201d he told her.<br />\u201cNo,\u201d Pilar said. \u201cBut so simple I am very complicated.</i><br />Another thing I wondered about was if bull fighting really such a thing, I mean everything anyone is reminiscent about seems related to bull fighting any half of the metaphors are about how fighting the fascists is as a lost case as the bull charging into the arena.<br /><br />Sometimes the writing has an excessive feel of and/then, and in general I thought this was really a slow book, but then there is a brilliant chapter 27 about a siege of a hill and I was compelled to read on. Maria with her trauma has more depth than I thought, and even if chapter 37 has a horribly protracted yet oblique sexscene but also fine observations about life in general: <br /><i>How little we know of what there is to know. I wish that I were going to live a long time instead of going to die today because I have learned much about life in these four days; more, I think, than in all the other time. I\u2019d like to be an old man and to really know. I wonder if you keep on learning or if there is only a certain amount each man can understand. I thought I knew about so many things that I know nothing of. I wish there was more time.</i><br /><br />Overall I felt this classic was a mixed bag, with the glimmers of brilliance in various chapters, including Chapter 42 which clear eyed shows the futility of ideology and the stupidity of the war, the helplessness and power hunger of those in charge, not being enough to make this an engaging read.<br /><br /><b>Quotes:</b><br /><i>Plenty overwhelmed. Golz was gay and he had wanted him to be gay too before he left, but he hadn\u2019t been.<br />All the best ones, when you thought it over, were gay. It was much better to be gay and it was a sign of something too. It was like having immortality while you were still alive. That was a complicated one.</i> - I know it's a bit high school of me, but I found this usage of the word gay (not to mention hotel Gaylords) unintentionally hilarious in the solemnity of Hemingway his writing.<br /><br /><i>\"It is not cowardly to know what is foolish.\u201d<br />\u201cNeither is it foolish to know what is cowardly,\u201d<br /><br />Your nationality and politics didn\u2019t show when you\u2019re dead<br /><br />It was easier to be part of a regime than to fight it<br /><br />Why don\u2019t you ever think of how it is to win? You\u2019ve been on the defensive for so long that you can\u2019t think of that. Sure. But that was before all that stuff went up this road. That was before all the planes came. Don\u2019t be so na\u00efve. But remember this that as long as we can hold them here we keep the fascists tied up. They can\u2019t attack any other country until they finish with us and they can never finish with us. If the French help at all, if only they leave the frontier open and if we get planes from America they can never finish with us. Never, if we get anything at all. These people will fight forever if they\u2019re well armed.<br /><br />No you must not expect victory here, not for several years maybe. This is just a holding attack. You must not get illusions about it now. Suppose we got a break-through today? This is our first big attack. Keep your sense of proportion. But what if we should have it? Don\u2019t<br /><br />Today is only one day in all the days that will ever be.

I hate to leave it very much and I hope I have done some good in it. I have tried to with what talent I had. Have, you mean.

The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very much to leave it. And you had a lot of luck, he told himself, to have had such a good life.</i>",

Sometimes very. Sometimes. <br /> <br />His style was distinctive. It was often parodied. Sometimes in book reviews.<br /> <br />He shot elephants for sport. He murdered lions. He fished Marlins. He watched Andalusian bulls die slow deaths while Spaniards danced around them.

It is spry and tough and bristles with sharp sentences that flash in the afternoon light. The book still takes all challengers, holding court in its sun-baked piazza, its old haunches disguising a muscular story that is a match for any young pretender.<br /> <br />This is a story of life and love and death.

They find something together, peace in the midst of carnage, and both must confront what their duty will mean for their new love.<br /><br />Through it all vibrant, tortured, politically riven Spain looms in the background.

    "text": "The Spanish are very emotional, passionate people. Hemingway wanted English readers to feel the passion of their language so he employed a few stylistic devices in his prose to convey that emotion. Hence, alot of 'thee and thou' and alot of implied literal translations. It's a sore point with many critics, but I thought it worked very well. It comes off sounding a bit Shakespearean in tone, which is suitable, I think, considering 'For Whom The Bell Tolls' is a tragic story of war and its collateral damage. <br /><br />Robert Jordan, the main protoganist, is a cool, young, level-headed American in the International Brigades fighting in the Spanish Civil War. The republican guerilla unit he is attached to is a motley crew of undisciplined local peasants, all highly emotional. It's Jordan's job as the dynamiter, to blow up a strategically important bridge in the middle of a major republican offensive strike against the fascists. With his volatile crew's help. <br /><br />There is a love story (very passionate) which is perhaps a bit hard to swallow, considering the entire novel takes place in the span of 3 days, but hey, the Spanish are passionate right? I'm ok with it though, because the story is a microcosm of the larger picture of the Spanish people and the fallout of war. We also learn of the complexity of the political environment leading up to the war, which, if you research, is hard to unravel, but fascinating nonetheless. <br /><br />Enough.<br /> It's Hemingway man. I dig Hemingway. <br />4 and a half stars from me.",

    "text": "Reviewed in May 2012<br /><br />The last Hemingway I read was <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/4631.A_Moveable_Feast\" title=\"A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway\" rel=\"noopener\">A Moveable Feast</a> and I enjoyed it a lot. It helped that I was staying in Paris when I read it so there was that extra special feeling we get when we walk the very streets an author describes in his stories. I think it suited Hemingway to write stories, and perhaps short novels - I also remember enjoying <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/2165.The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea\" title=\"The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway\" rel=\"noopener\">The Old Man and the Sea</a> and images from that book stayed with me for years. <br />In spite of those good experiences, I couldn't relate to this book. I had just finished reading Xavier Cercas' <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/23859.Soldiers_of_Salamis\" title=\"Soldiers of Salamis by Javier Cercas\" rel=\"noopener\">Soldiers of Salamis: A Novel</a> when I picked up <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>.<br />Cercas' book is a mixture of fact and fiction revolving around events and personalities associated with the Spanish civil war so I figured it was a good idea to follow that reading with this book by Hemingway since it concerns some of the same events. Everything recounted by Cercas, even the fictional parts, have an aura of 'truth' about them. You just believe these events happened and that the characters reacted in the way described. Such a 'truth' is not easy task to convey, especially when the author is working with events which took place more then 60 years previously.<br /><br />Hemingway wrote his novel much closer to the time of the events described yet I couldn't manage to make that leap into believing in the fiction he was presenting. Most of the characters didn't seem credible to me. The main character, Robert Jordan, whom Hemingway continually refers to by his full name in an awkward way, is not so much a character as a monument to male ego tripping. He is big, he is blonde, he is strong, he is an expert in explosives, he is wise, he is always right and he gets the only girl in the place within minutes of meeting her. <br /> <br />Another of the main characters, who is constantly referred to by Hemingway as 'the wife of Pablo' rather than Pablo's wife, is also a larger than life creation, bearing closer resemblance to some sybil of the ancient world than to a Spanish peasant woman of the 1930's. You admire her wisdom but you just can't believe she's real. Most of the characters speak a dialect of Spanish which H tries to render in English using lots of 'thees' and 'thous' and some convoluted constructions similar to 'the wife of Pablo' above. When this is done in dialogue, I can see the point of it as it reinforces the idea that this is all taking place in Spain, in Spanish. When the author also uses such constructions in narrative passages, it just becomes wearisome to read. <br /><br />The writing is stiff and awkward, as if written under some invisible constraint, and It lacks any kind of emotion. I am tempted to compare it to watching a man walking about in trousers which are too tight around the crotch, there is that kind of jerky limbs and stilted movement. <br /><br />Perhaps I would have had a different reaction to this book had I read it at an earlier point in my life. Perhaps then I would have ignored these idiosyncrasies and just concentrated on getting to the end to see how the story turned out. These days, I'm less interested in how the story turns out.",

    "text": "\u201cThe world is a fine place and worth fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cFor what are we born if not to aid one another?\u201d<br /><br />The Spanish Civil War was fought from 1936-39. (WWII was fought from 1939-1945, just for a frame of reference). When an initial military coup in Spain failed to win control of the entire country, a bloody civil war ensued. The Nationalists, as the rebels were called, received aid from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The Republicans (with whom our hero Robert Jordan fought) received aid from the Soviet Union as well as a group called The International Brigades, composed of volunteers from Europe and the US. <br /><br />Ernest Hemingway was in Spain to cover the civil war as a journalist, and some of what he features in For Whom the Bell Tolls, his (fictional) book that takes place during that civil war, is informed by his research there, as well as his general anti-fascist commitments. <br /><br />For Whom the Bell Tolls is one of the five central/most important works from the Nobel Prize-winning author from Oak Park, Illinois (where I am now living, the reviewer says, as if Hem had been one of his personal best friends), including also The Sun Also Rises (also taking place in Papa\u2019s beloved Spain, in Pamplona, during the Festival, the Running of the Bulls, focused on a group of drunken revelers including a Hem stand-in); A Farewell to Arms (set during the Italian campaign of WWI, where Frederick Henry has a torrid affair with Catherine Barkley; Hem was an ambulance driver in Italy in WWI, injuring himself and creating the conditions for his novel Farewell, as he fell in love with his nurse while in the hospital: so a war romance); The Old Man and the Sea (a story about an aging fisherman in Cuba and the fish of his life, a marlin), and last but I think his greatest accomplishment, his Collected Stories.<br /><br />I know a lot of people don\u2019t like Hem now; his treatment of women is seen by many as shallow, romanticized. Is it his macho (bi-polar, some now suspect) personality? Something about his drinking? The no trophy hunting and romanticizing of bull fighting? His satirizably minimalist prose? I dunno, I get all that, but in returning to this book, I still think it is a great novel, one of his literary triumphs.<br /><br />The Spanish Civil War was a kind of precursor to WWII\u2019s fight against totalitarianism/fascism--Hitler, Mussolini--though in Spain it was Franco. FWTBT is an impassioned plea, published in 1940 just after the second World War began, but before the US was quite committed to it, to fight the forces of fascism worldwide. One could argue that the revolution fell short in Spain, but Hem made the moral case for it in his novel, nevertheless. You have to fight fascism, making war a necessary evil.<br /><br />\u201cNever think that war, no matter how necessary nor how justified, is not a crime. Ask the infantry and ask the dead.\u201d<br /><br />The story is about a University of Colorado Spanish instructor, Robert Jordan, who volunteers, as did many Americans and others from many countries, against Franco. On one level it is a micro-focused close-up story of three days focused on one incident, the blowing of one bridge by Jordan, aided by a ragtag band of guerillas, gypsies, undermanned and beleaguered. It\u2019s also the story of a three-day romance between Jordan and Maria, a but it also includes some finely-etched characters: Pilar, the matriarchal peasant leader, her drunk husband Pablo, the beloved pacifist guide Anselmo. We spend a long time getting ready for an attack that will occasion the dynamiting of the bridge, one small moment in a larger conflict.<br /><br />The book is hampered by language censorship of the period, so one has to guess what words Hem has in mind when he writes, \u201cI obscenity in the milk of thy mother\u2019s obscenity,\u201d and so on. Which can be annoying, but also amusing sometimes. And maybe the nineteen-year-old Maria is not any more admirable as a female romantic figure than Cat is in Farewell to Arms, but to me the romance really still works after all these years in my re-reading of it. Maybe the effort Hem makes to distinguish between the formal and informal address in Spanish can be a bit annoying, too many \u201cthous\u201d and \u201cthees.\u201d Maybe the stream of consciousness reflection for Jordan goes on too long at times, sure.<br /><br />But there are powerful scenes in this book that indict the fascists, and also one unforgettable story from Pilar that also indicts the resistance in its cruel killing of some rich fascists in one town, incidents she herself observed. There\u2019s a good Catch 22-like view of the dangers of military miscommunication that goes on behind the lines as Jordan needs to warn the leader Golz that the planned attack must be delayed.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of the book is the degree to which psychic phenomena can be relied on in living one\u2019s life. Pilar, a person Jordan truly respects as (otherwise) wise, reads his palm and sees a dark future for him; he, typically a rationalist, dismisses any such prophecies as silly superstition. Yet when he makes love with Maria and \u201cthe earth moves,\u201d he is unskeptical about the mysteries of love:<br /><br />\u201cOh, now, now, now, the only now, and above all now, and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWhat you have with Maria, whether it lasts just through today and a part of tomorrow, or whether it lasts for a long life is the most important thing that can happen to a human being. There will always be people who say it does not exist because they cannot have it. But I tell you it is true and that you have it and that you are lucky even if you die tomorrow.\u201d<br /><br />Does that sound like a rationalist?! He\u2019s a realist about war and death, but he\u2019s also a romantic existentialist when it comes to love:<br /><br />\u201cThere is nothing else than now. There is neither yesterday, certainly, nor is there any tomorrow. How old must you be before you know that? There is only now, and if now is only two days, then two days is your life and everything in it will be in proportion. This is how you live a life in two days. And if you stop complaining and asking for what you never will get, you will have a good life. A good life is not measured by any biblical span.\u201d<br /><br />Jordan (and maybe Hem) can\u2019t finally completely dismiss the mystical way his group of gypsies, guerrillas and vagabonds often see the world. He's also about mystery in many ways.<br /><br />Finally, Jordan/Hemingway is persuasive and admirable when he makes a case for fighting against fascism wherever it rises up:<br /><br />\u201cIt was a feeling of consecration to a duty toward all of the oppressed of the world which would be as difficult and embarrassing to speak about as religious experience and yet it was as authentic as the feeling you had when you heard Bach, or stood in Chartres Cathedral or the Cathedral at Le\u00f3n and saw the light coming through the great windows; or when you saw Mantegna and Greco and Brueghel in the Prado.\u201d<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Jordan also talks with the guerillas about fascism in the US:<br /><br />\u201cBut are there not many fascists in your country?\"<br />\"There are many who do not know they are fascists but will find it out when the time comes.\u201d<br /><br />This is, to me, a great novel, very inspiring and moving with great lyrical passages.<br />",

    "text": "A Difficult Romanticism<br /><br />Hemingway's novel \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" (1940) is toughly realistic in its depiction of the butchery of warfare. The book has the no-nonsense, fact-intensive style of a reporter. Yet, in its themes of love, death, heroism, and human brotherhood, Hemingway's novel is, in spite of itself, romantic in outlook, but romantic with an edge.<br /><br />The novel is set in Spain in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). The Spanish Civil War was a multi-sided conflict between the democratically-elected government, the Republicans or loyalists, and its right-wing anti-communist opponents, the nationalists (fascists). The Republicans during this conflict had the assistance of the USSR. Their enemies, the nationalists, were assisted by Nazi Germany and by Italy. Hemingway was a correspondent in Spain at the time. His novel tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American instructor in Spanish at the University of Montana who had earlier spent much time wandering through Spain. In 1936, with the outset of the conflict, Jordan volunteered his services to assist the Republicans and became an expert in explosives. Jordan idealizes his grandfather who had been a hero in the American Civil War. Jordan's father had committed suicide. When the novel opens, Jordan is assigned to destroy a bridge in furtherance of a Republican offensive. He works with a group of guerrillas in the mountains.<br /><br />The story unfolds over a time of three days. Hemingway's book offers portrayals of a group of Jordan's Spanish compatriots, in addition to Jordan himself. Chief among them is a 48-year old woman, Pilar, physically unattractive, earthy, and strong-willed. She is the de facto leader of her group and is as central to the story as is Jordan. Pilar is the \"woman\" of Pablo, who was once a formidable fighter but who has become disillusioned by the conflict. The novel includes several scenes of high tension and near violence between Jordan and Pablo. In his efforts to blow-up the bridge, Jordan is assisted by Anselmo, an aged man who despairs of violence and killing but is devoted to the Republican cause. And, in the three days of the novel, Jordan meets and has a passionate love affair with Maria, a lovely 19-year old who has been saved from the nationalists by Pablo.<br /><br />Hemingway is known for a terse, elliptical writing style, and it is on display in this book. But the writing is highly varied, with long stream of conscious digressions by Jordan as he reflects upon his past life and upon the conflict in which he has thrust himself. Much of the writing is both figurative and digressive. Hemingway tried to transcribe much of Spanish idiom directly into English, particularly the use of \"thou\" for the intimate Spanish \"you.\" He also makes considerable use of untranslated Spanish phrases. The book captures the speech patterns of soldiers under tension, with much use of colorful language. Hemingway does not reproduce this language directly but, in English, uses phrases such as \"obscenity\" or \"unprintable\" in place of the words themselves. In addition to telling the story of the bridge and its destruction, all the characters engage in long discussions of their thoughts and their prior lives. These discussions generally are directed to the brutality of the war. In an outstanding passage, Pilar tells of the destruction under the command of Pablo of a group of fascist leaders who are forced to run the gauntlet before being thrown down a cliff.<br /><br />Hemingway was in love with Spain, both for its beauty and its brutality. The novel has many discussions of bullfighting, largely told by Pilar as she recounts her experiences with earlier lovers. Pilar also has a power of clairvoyance in the story, especially as it relates to impending death. The book includes several vivid battle scenes. One of these scenes tells of the gunning-down by aircraft of a group of five of the guerillas assisting Jordan at the top of a small hill.(Aircraft has a large and fearsome presence in the book.) Another effective battle scene tells of the difficult destruction of the bridge and its aftermath.<br /><br />The love relationship between Robert Jordan and Maria comes to dominate the novel. The two become passionately attracted to each other and quickly consummate their relationship. The passages describing the couple's lovemaking are central to the story and effective. The inhumanity of war is juxtaposed against human commitment and the beauty of the everyday. Robert Jordan realizes that he is in love with Maria, Spain, and with life. This love, in the book, reaches its peak in heroism and self-sacrifice. Jordan comes to realize what in life he values. It is because of his realization, that he ultimately must give up the things he comes to cherish. Within its language of toughness and machismo, this novel has the theme of inevitability and of romantic tragedy.<br /><br />This is a book I read in high school many years ago when it was far beyond me. It is not an easy book, and not every part of it is successful. But it is an extraordinary novel. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to revisit the book when I was able to try to appreciate it.<br /><br />Robin Friedman",

    "text": "I read the opening few pages and instantly knew 3 things:<br />1. I was going to love this book.<br />2. I needed a whole pad of post-its to mark quotes.<br />3. I wanted to read this in Spanish for the rich poetry the language would add.<br /><br />A young boy Daniel is taken by his father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and told to salvage a book which he must take stewardship over. He choses a novel\u2014or maybe it chose him\u2014that touches him, stirs his desire for literature, and forever entangles him with the fate of the book and its author. The strange author died in poverty but now someone is seeking out all remaining copies of his unsuccessful novels to burn. Daniel embarks on a mission to solve the mystery of the author's story being watched by a revengeful cop and the book burner himself. As the story twists and slowly unravels he doesn't know whose account to trust or how it will affect his life.<br /><br />Wrapped up in the mystery is a message of death: do we live a full life or wander through it numb? The Shadow of the Wind is an allegory for death in a fictitious novel by the same title. Shadow is a perfect symbol for death evoking images of how death can be metaphorical instead of literal\u2014living shadows of lives, chasing shadows of dreams, being shadows of others, letting memories shadow life. Every character had shadows which could engulf them or they could overcome. In this sense death becomes a fate we chose ourselves. For death is not always the worst thing that can happen (\"words are not always the worst prison\"). Every time the word shadow was used I considered its illusion of death. It was with much thought that the word was scattered throughout the book. <br /><br /><b>Spoilers</b><br />Just as the fictitious novel was an echo of the book and Julian's life, I loved watching Daniel's life parallel Julian's. Both grew up poor without an ideal family life, fell in love with a rich girl who was the adoration of her father and whose brother was a best friend, evoked murderous anger from her father after impregnating her, and when they have a brush with death, extremes of hate and love anchored their fight to survive. As Julian's story unfolds, Daniel unwittingly finds himself in the exact same point of their duel destiny.<br /><br />Once Daniel is aware of the correlation, the comparison stops. Is it because Daniel consciously chooses to chance his path or has fate dealt him a better hand? Julian wrote \"There are no coincidences. We are the puppets of our subconscious desires.\" But while the message is clear that we chose our own fate, it seems there was no fate but failure for Julian. The sad thing is I believed Julian's love for Penelope as it grew in obsession more than Daniel's love for Beatriz which seemed a happy chance of lust.<br /><br />Themes of devils and angels are prevalent as characters save and ruin each others' lives. Clara is a physical angel who is blind while Fumero an emotional devil blinded by hate. While women tended to be described as angel and men devil, most characters held both in different shades. Take Julian the angel child bringing life (love, novels) who turned into the devil Lain Coubert bringing death (destruction, fear). But the characters pick whether to accept the destiny allotted them. Fermin was living death in the shadows of the street who had to get over his demons to find life worth living. The shadows for Nuria, Julian, Fortuny, even Fumero didn't have to give them a reason to quit living. They chose shadows.<br /><br />The book reminded me of The 13th Tale thematically, linguistically, and in delivery, although I loved this book so much more. The way the mystery unfolds finding tidbits from different perspectives enhanced the mystery and aided the depth of characterization. When I can see the vicious wife beater, deceived husband, and regretful father all in Antonio Fortuny I get a more well rounded sense of his motives. I enjoyed how the characters played different roles for each other.<br /><br />I love Barcelona as the setting. If you've been to the artistically enchanting city, you know it's the perfect backdrop to this eloquently enchanting tale with a gothic feel. The Spanish have a way of making all things metaphorically beautiful. The vivid romantic passages had me smiling and at times laughing out loud. I highly enjoyed the writing and it wasn't until two-thirds of the way into the book that the story finally stole my complete attention. Julian was my initial guess and while the story kept me questioning, it was the best solution and I was happy with the conclusion.<br /><br />But no novel is perfect; my issues are these:<br />1. The readymade quotes are extreme. Zafon salvages this by calling himself out on the commentary. He sets the comments up in dialogue and then uses another character to mock the snippets.<br /><br />2. Perspective, particularly in Nuria's letter, is off. How could she know what Miquel looked at when dying? The chapters of her letters change from direct commentary to Daniel to third-party narrative. Elsewhere in the novel Daniel summarizes conversations in italics but I wondered from whence the interruption of her narrative with Fumero's story came.<br /><br />3. I always hope historical fiction will showcase a more accurate moral setting, but it rarely happens. While I believed the sex about Zafon's characters, done in secret and with fathers chasing down the culprits, how could they find out they were pregnant the next day? I was also disappointed that all marriages were displayed as wrong and wives disregarded. Oh well. I guess it added to the Spanish flavor of the book.<br /><br />4. American authors tend to impose unrealistic happy endings while Europeans favor poignant sad ones. At one point it seemed bad things happened to Julian for nothing else than this love of tragedies. It seemed Zafon was going to ruin the characters lives to make a point. But he makes his point with Julian and leaves Daniel to gives us a satisfied ending. A story about the living dead cannot be all bliss but we still find redemption as the characters step out of the shadows and live their lives. <br /><br /><b>Quotes:</b><br />Few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart.<br />I believed, with the innocence of those who can still count their age on their fingers, that if I closed my eyes and spoke to her, she would be able to hear me wherever I was. <br />A secret's worth depends on the people form whom it must be kept.<br />Women have an infallible instinct for knowing when a man has fallen madly in love with them, especially when the male in question is both a complete dunce and a minor.<br />Death was like a nameless and incomprehensible hand...like a hellish lottery ticket.

    "text": "<b>4.5/5 stars<br><br>An astonishingly engaging story within a story type of novel; the passion for books and reading introduced in the first chapter was just an appetizer before all the interconnecting twists and turns.</b><br><br>I\u2019ve been having a lot of good lucks lately in reading books outside of epic fantasy\u2014my favorite sub-genre. <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> is a novel that I\u2019ve heard so many positive things about for several years; it is one of those books that\u2019s often recommended by readers, regardless of their main preferences sub-genre of reading. And now that I\u2019ve read it, I can understand why it received all the critical acclaims. Sheer brilliance in storytelling and writing aside, <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> is a book about books, a story about a story, and it would be difficult for readers\u2014who obviously love books\u2014of all kind of genre to resist the charm in the narrative. I\u2019m going backward here because <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> was published first, but if you\u2019ve read and loved <i>The Ten Thousand Doors of January</i> by Alix E. Harrow, I think you\u2019re going to love this novel as well. These two books have many similarities in themes and their approaches to the passion for books and its mystery + coming-of-age centered plotlines.<br><br><b>\n  <i>\n    <blockquote>\u201cIn the shop we buy and sell them, but in truth books have no owner. Every book you see here has been somebody\u2019s best friend.\u201d</blockquote>\n  </i>\n</b><br><br><i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> is the first book in <i>The Cemetery of Forgotten Books</i> quartet by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n. The story takes place in Barcelona, 1945, and here\u2019s the short premise of the novel. On his eleventh birthday, Daniel Sempere wakes up and finds out that he cannot remember the face of his mother anymore. To cheer him up, Daniel\u2019s father takes him to the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library that holds the books forgotten by the world, just sitting there waiting for the right reader to choose a book that will hold a special meaning to them. Daniel selects a book titled The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax, and he falls in love with it immensely, then he seeks other books written by Julian only to find out that someone has been destroying every book written by the author. He may just be holding the last copy of the author\u2019s work, and he\u2019s trying to solve the mystery behind this bizarre incident. <br><br><b>\n  <i>\n    <blockquote>\u201cEvery book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.\u201d </blockquote>\n  </i>\n</b><br><br>As I mentioned, <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> is a story within a story. It tells a coming-of-age story of Daniel Sempere as he tries to unravel the mystery behind Julian Carax and the disappearances of his novels. Despite this novel has been published for more than a decade\u2014almost two decades in its original language\u2014now, I somehow was able to approach this book knowing close to nothing; I plan to keep it that way for future readers who stumbles upon this review. Let me, however, say that I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by how much I grew to care about the characters in this novel, especially for Daniel and Fermin\u2014Fermin is hands down my favorite character of the book. Daniel\u2019s story and the secrets he unravels continuously gripped me, Fermin\u2019s personality plus his dialogues are so intoxicating, and most of all the friendship these two nurtured is incredibly heartwarming.<br><br><b>\n  <i>\n    <blockquote>\u201cOne of the pitfalls of childhood is that one doesn't have to understand something to feel it. By the time the mind is able to comprehend what has happened, the wounds of the heart are already too deep.\u201d </blockquote>\n  </i>\n</b><br><br>I haven\u2019t been to Barcelona, what I know of it, I see, learn, and heard from other people and other media. However, there\u2019s a super atmospheric quality that\u2019s so immersive to Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s writing; when I was reading the book, it feels like I was truly there. I\u2019m in a similar situation with my friends, in that I haven\u2019t read the book in its original language, and because of this, I can\u2019t gauge the accuracy of the translations. But as far as reading the book in English goes, the translation done by Lucia Graves flows absolutely well. There were a few flashback sections where I found the book to be slightly uneven in its pacing, but for the majority of the novel, Zaf\u00f3n\u2019s prose and Graves\u2019 translations were extraordinarily compelling and accessible. I\u2019m serious; I lost count on how many passages I highlighted because they were so well-written and relatable to me.<br><br><b>\n  <i>\n    <blockquote>\u201cBea says that the art of reading is slowly dying, that it's an intimate ritual, that a book is a mirror that offers us only what we already carry inside us, that when we read, we do it with all our heart and mind, and great readers are becoming more scarce by the day.\u201d </blockquote>\n  </i>\n</b><br><br><b>Picture: <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> by Vincent Chong</b><br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1585646707i/29203305._SY540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>There\u2019s simply no scarcity of insightful and wise remarks within this novel that brims with resonating themes of growing up, love, found family, friendship, and books. In equal measure, it\u2019s also filled with revenge, loss, and tragedy. <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> is an amazing piece of literature that begins and concluded its story in a richly satisfying way. Do note that although this is the first book of a quartet, the novel worked wonderfully well as a standalone; I\u2019m actually surprised that there are three more books in the series. If any one of the sequels is as good as this one, then I know I\u2019m in for more unforgettable stories to read.<br><br><b>\n  <i>\n    <blockquote>\u201cI was raised among books, making invisible friends in pages that seemed cast from dust and whose smell I carry on my hands to this day.\u201d </blockquote>\n  </i>\n</b><br><br><b>You can order the book from: <u><a href=\"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780143034902/?a_aid=petrikleo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Book Depository (Free shipping)</a></u></b><br><br><b>You can find <u><a href=\"http://novelnotions.net/2020/03/31/book-review-the-shadow-of-the-wind-the-cemetery-of-forgotten-books-1-by-carlos-ruiz-zafon/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this</a></u> and the rest of my reviews at <u><a href=\"http://novelnotions.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Novel Notions</a></u></b><br><br><i>Special thanks to my Patrons on <b><u><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/petrikleo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Patreon</a></u></b> for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!<br><br>My Patrons: Alfred, Devin, Hamad, Joie, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas.</i>",

    "text": "There's probably nothing much I \"learned\" in the introspective sense, but this is a novel like a novel ought to be. This is an epic film on paper, gloomy and engaging, smokey, noir with crumbling ruins, young love, disfigurment, lust, torture...the stuff of Dumas, DuMauier and, as of late, The Historian. I woke up at five a.m. and had to sweet talk myself back to sleep: all I wanted to do was read. One Friday, after work, I took sanctuary in The Hotel Biron, those little tables in the dark, pages flickering with candles and drank a glass of wine in solitude, completely enthralled in the world of 1940's Barcelona.<br />I walked home from the train at night and found myself saying the characters names beneath my umbrella, hoping no one would hear me <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/82535.Things_I_Overheard_While_Talking_to_Myself\" title=\"Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself by Alan Alda\" rel=\"noopener\">talking to myself</a>, but they were, quite simply, too beautiful to ignore: Julian Carax, Daniel Semepere, Beatriz...Tomas, Penelope Aldaya and Nuria Monfort.<br />In a movie this would be too many people, but for this novel they were perfectly seamed, each point of view more entralling and taxing than the one before.<br />Most refreshing, clearly the author wasn't poisoned with the desire to simply keep the reader in the dark: instead this story, with attention, was something you could figure out--because that's the way life is. The mystery itself isn't supposed to shock you intensely into thinking a book is good, that's a dirty trick. Instead, the STORY carried you. You cared about the story and it was a tragity and mystery all the same, simply because you were invested in these people and what became of them. To know them so intimately from childhood to adulthood and old age, to know them through various degrees of point of view seperation--to hear there is no Penelope, and then to know she is a sister, a love, but to some non-existant...well, it's gothic literature at it's very best.<br />With a book like this I am almost, ALMOST tempted to give up my most pedantic and pretentious thoughts, paralells and character development--this story is a story and it's just that good. It is the Phantom of the Opera, those dark tunnels and pressure points, a lake with candles or drawing rooms with no fire in the grate and crazy wives being stored in attics over head. This is, quite literally a timeless tale, and yes, reading it will make you smarter, more interested, more cultured (the back of the book includes a walking tour of Barcelona. I missed Barcelona but I am quite determined to go now, with my copy of A Shadow of the Wind in hand, just like wanting desperately to visit Eastern Europe after I finished The Historian and see it all), but more importantly real life simply fades to black as you become completely, totally and fantastically helpless and wrapped up in the lives of others.<br />While there are fun hybrids--Crash Topics in Calamity Physics, for one, which combine a courses, authors, quotes and plot lines from a thousand famous novels, this book really makes that unnecessary. This is a classic without any help, no cheat cheats necessary. Read it. Read it. Read it.<br /><br />**I write on books and other stuff at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.snapshotnarrative.tumblr.com\">www.snapshotnarrative.tumblr.com</a>",

    "text": "After reading The Shadow of the Wind, I was left with somewhat mixed feelings. On the one hand, this is such a beautifully written book, and is in essence an ode to literature. On the other hand, there are some serious flaws which distracts from the whole experience. <br /><br />The best thing about the book, in my opinion, is Zafon's skill in artistic writing. It reminds me of why I love to read in the first place, and makes me wish I could write as beautiful as this. The book contains lots of memorable quotes as well, definitely a good thing as far as I'm concerned. <br /><br />So after about 50 pages in, I was ready to love this book as I seldom loved another book before. But as the story progressed, that resolution started to diminish slowly but surely. Ironically, one the more obvious flaws is Zafon's overuse of stylistic writing. It seems like everyone acts or talks in a very elaborate manner, even in the simplest of situations, and this can really become tiresome after a while. <br /><br />The plot also isn't as ingenious as the hype would make you believe. Zafon does a good job creating a sense of mystery early on, and there are obvious parallels between the main character Daniel Sempere, and Julian Carax, the writer whose past he is trying to uncover. But ultimately, the stories of Daniel and Julian are seperate ones, and they just happen to interconnect with one another more by chance than by design. <br /><br />By far the most troublesome flaw is the way the mysteries are \"resolved\". All too often, answers are given by having some side character or another tell his or her story for pages. Nowhere is this more evident than at the end of the book, where literally every single detail is revealed in the form of a (very) long letter, even details which the writer of the letter never could have known, since she wasn't even involved in those events. It's as if Zafon did not have a clue or the motivation to write a logical conclusion, and decided to just dump all the information in one place. <br /><br />With a bit more attention to actual plot and character development, this could have been one of my favourite books. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed reading the Shadow of the Wind. It's just a shame that it falls some way short of its potential.",

    "text": "I can't believe someone actually published this book. Even worse, in my opinion is the fact that this book is on the New York Times Bestseller List. How is this possible? It must only mean that there are a lot of people out there that think very differently from me. Don't you be one of them. Seriously. Don't be fooled by this book. It is insipid, lame, and poorly written. <br /><br />First. The prose is so overblown that the author uses three adjectives for every single noun. Count them. He evidently was told that to be a writer you have to make everything as descriptive as possible, and then he decided that meant that each noun had to be modified three, always three, and only three times. Argh.<br /><br />Second. The author must have looked up every word he could in a thesaurus and chosen the one that was most obscure or had the most syllables. Who is he trying to impress? Maybe it was the translator's fault? Maybe not. Either way, this style is used even when describing what the ten year old character sees and says. Which brings me to my next point.<br /><br />Third. Every character in this book speaks with exactly the same voice. All you hear is the authors voice, not any different characterizations. And that voice demonstrates the problems I described in my first and second points. But that's not all. There is an even worse, and definitely fatal, problem with this book.<br /><br />Fourth. This story was written as a mystery. Nine years lurch by as the character slowly tries to unravel the details of the main conflict. I actually don't have a problem with this in theory. Unfortunately, after three quarters of the book, and numerous new characters, the mystery is no clearer. So what does the author do about it? He has one of the characters write a 30 page (or so) letter to the main character telling him what really happened. Ta-da. The mystery is solved. The author is such a terrible writer that he can't even solve his own mystery. He has to use a cheap cop-out to clear everything up. <br /><br />I can't respect that. Sorry. I can't believe so many other people have. <br /><br />Boycott the book. Really.<br /><br /> ",

It starts and ends in a library of sorts, themes and plots are echoed across decades, tied together by actors who find their roles changing, and by a pen that links two cycles of the story and has its own tale that started before and goes on beyond.<br /><br />\"the art of reading is slowly dying, it's an intimate ritual, a book is a mirror that offers us only what we already carry inside us, when we read, we do it with all our heart and mind, and great readers are becoming more scarce by the day.\u201d<br /><br />Zaf\u00f3n is a master of prose, he is eminently quotable even in translation. The story is set in Barcelona and stretches from the turn of the 19th century to the sixties, though focusing most heavily in post civil war Spain recovering in the 40s and 50s. It's a bitter sweet story, as much about the slow acceptance of loss as about fighting against it or finding happiness.<br /><br />\"Most of us have the good or bad fortune of seeing our lives fall apart so slowly we barely notice it.\"<br /><br />The setting is vividly brought to life. Many of the characters live in poverty or close to it, and the ventures into Paris bring to mind Orwell's descriptions.

Both of them finding difficult and potentially tragic love.<br /><br />\"Her voice was pure crystal, transparent and so fragile I feared that her words would break if I interrupted them.\"<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind has a lot to say about books and reading, rather less to say about the business of writing though.<br /><br />\"Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you.\"<br /><br />\"Novels, as everyone knew, were for women and for people with nothing better to do.\"<br /><br />It's a complex interwoven plot, not without threat and violence, with a series of reveals that undermine what you think you know.<br /><br />A fascinating and lovely read, and a nice break from the fantasy books that I have read almost exclusively over the last 5 years.<br /><br />Give it a try!<br /><br /><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/marklawrenceauthor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Join my Patreon</a><br /> <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/cimnK1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes</a><br /><br />..",

One of the essential tools for this is the <br /><br />Mysterious book<br />This single plot device enables Zafon to make credible main story arcs and construct an amazing panorama of Spanish culture. Of course, he doesn\u00b4t just point the finger at the evil protagonist, but at the ideologies that made them monsters, which has certainly led to the one or other conservative outcry when it was published and became an international megaseller as an extra bonus. It could also be that it was the authors' intent to push the sales by especially aiming at this effect.<br /><br />Inception style story within a story<br />Maybe one of the best uses of this trope I\u00b4ve ever seen, linked with family history. While the book is the main physical red line, the backflip retrospective time loop effect makes the character development more suspenseful and always opens questions about the many different options the story could push forward, leaving the reader no time to rest together with the great characters.<br /><br />The perfect dose of sadness<br />There is absolutely no overkill of emotions or tragedy, it always stays in the acceptable dose range and, very probably, is credible too. See, I\u00b4ve some kind of problems with objectively assessing how good emotional descriptions are, because I tend to rate plot and ideas over characters in most of my reading (and am dead and cold inside) and novels like that are exceptions in my schedule to camouflage my totally \u00fcber cool weirdness and try to understand human relationships and emotions. But with incompetent subjectivity, I deem it sweeping without escalating towards soap opera for just any moment.<br /><br />Fascistic dictatorship until 1977<br />This historic anomaly, with the extra bonus of hardcore conservatism and Catholicism, is what makes Spain a European exception. A socioeconomic and epigenetic subject that is certainly in full focus of many humanities, as it shows the longtime effects of such terrible management styles in all fields of society. For Spanish readers, it adds the reading bonus of nonfiction facts and a move towards reappraisal and a culture of remembrance that uses objective measures just as in all other countries haunted by fascism. It\u00b4s extremely disturbing to think about the fact that Francos' terror continued for 3 decades after all other European dictatorships had been crushed in WW2.<br /><br />The love for and magic of books<br />Many philosophical and metaphysical options to talk about imagination, the power of fantasy, or just living in fictional universes, but no matter what one picks, it\u00b4s a declaration of love for the best hobby to rule them all. And, of course, accelerate the, hopefully not backlashy and incestuously degenerating, course of history by spreading wisdom, enlightenment, and progressive ideas.<br /><br />Easy to enter for all groups of readers<br />One of these novels everyone, no matter what genre preferences, more in character or plot focused works, should read, because the ingenuity of unique pieces like that lies in taking anything that already worked well in creative writing and endless amounts of tropes, postmodern deconstructed stereotypes, and mechanisms to assemble them to such an unforgettable reading fun.<br /><br />The role of women in dark times<br />With full focus on how the sick, conservative, and sheer evil ideologies torture women, Zafon creates intense and sad pictures of the ultimate consequences of alpha male dominance. War and murder are the big picture, but what is often forgotten are the unknown and uncounted numbers of abused and raped women, who were forced to abort their unworthy mongrel babies, because of Christian charity and autocratic governments working together to create real life hellhole prison states.<br /><br />There is no substitute<br />I could endlessly talk about what makes it great, but instead, I will encourage everyone to read it, and Irving and Simmons I already mentioned of course too. In all three cases, I ask myself how long it takes to write such works and how it\u00b4s even possible, although I would agree with Stephen King, who said he is envious because Simmons writes like a God. And probably all of the three are half-Gods, alien human hybrids, or something, I could find no serious scientific literature dealing with this theory, but still deem it an option.<br /><br />Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: <br /><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowOfTheWind\">https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...</a>",

    "text": "<b>Fifth reading:</b> September 8-11, 2021<br />I can't believe it's been over 4 years since I last read this masterpiece! Part of me is glad that I waited a bit between re-reads since it let me forget some of the elements of the story, which made rediscovering them even more enjoyable. However, what I didn't forget is how much I truly love this book. And it remains my favorite book ever. I know I'm super biased, but I just think it's fantastic, and I find it hard to believe any book will ever beat this one for me. Even though I can see its criticisms (particularly the lack of well-rounded female characters in this story), my pleasure in falling headfirst into this world every time I read this book is unlike any other reading experience. I can't wait to keep visiting it with the other books in this series soon.<br /><br /><b>Fourth reading:</b> May 7-17, 2017<br />Of course I love this book soooo much. It's my all-time favorite. This is the 4th year in a row I've read it, and it never gets old. If you haven't already read this at my suggestion, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!<br /><br /><b>Third reading:</b> May 14-21, 2016<br /><br /><b>Second reading:</b> May 23-25, 2015-<br />Okay, I can confidently say, upon re-reading this, that it is one of my all-time favorite books. It was just as surprising and enchanting and delightful as the first time I read it, if not more so. The writing is impeccable. The weaving together of so many storylines and characters is remarkable. I can't gush enough about this book, so I will just say EVERYONE GO READ THIS NOW PLEASE. You won't regret it.<br /><br /><b>First read:</b> May 12-17, 2014-<br />Everything about this novel was captivating. The story follows Daniel, a young boy, whose father is a bookseller. He is taken to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and allowed to pick out one book that he is expected to 'save' or, in a sense, remember throughout his life. He picks a novel by Julian Carax titled \"The Shadow of the Wind,\" and is immediately sucked into the story. From there, the novel follows Daniel as he begins to learn more about the illusive author, Julian Carax, and about the web of lies and intrigue that he gets trapped in.<br /><br />The writing is absolutely gorgeous. The book is full of incredible quotes, wonderful, beautifully strung out sentences. I never underline in books. This book, however, required a pencil at the ready at all times, because I couldn't pass up underlining some amazing parts.<br /><br />Though the plot isn't super strong, there is a mysterious and magical quality to the book that propels you through it, page after page. The characters feel so real, and thus their lives seem to be playing out for you in such a real way that you are concerned and invested, wanting to know what happens next.<br /><br />I loved the setting of Barcelona. This is also a book translated from Spanish, which is even more impressive on the part of the translator. I think the translation was incredible.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book that I will return to again in my life, I am sure. It is captivating and a new favorite. 5/5.",

    "text": "This is an excellent piece of literature. It contains poetic storytelling, shocking twists, thoroughly developed characters, symbolism, humor, romance, betrayal, action, sentimentality, nostalgia, and much, much more. <br /><br />For book lovers it is perfect because it revolves around the mysteries of a little known author (Julian Carax) that the main protagonist, Daniel, stumbles across in a secret stash of literature called the Cemetery of Forgotten books. From there it quickly develops into a fantastic story of good vs. evil; driven by jealousy and shrouded in the unknown.<br /><br />I saw some complaints that this book is slow. I can understand that - it is not a light book and it is not a quick read. But, the payoff from getting immersed in the thick narrative is totally worth the extra time in the end.<br /><br />Lovers of books, lovers of historical fiction, lovers of mysteries with shocking twists, lovers of complex romance/revenge story lines, lovers of ultimate good vs evil battles - step right in to The Cemetery of Forgotten Books . . . and lose yourself in The Shadow of the Wind.",

Zaf\u00f3n seems to have swallowed a thesaurus and proceeds to regurgitate synonyms with unrelenting force. In <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i>, a man does not simply urinate, he \"<i>discharge[s] his generous, steamy cascade.</i>\" <br /><br /><i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> is an ode to books that's not so much Gothic literature as it's a telenovela, a trait that's only exacerbated by Jonathan Davis' melodramatic delivery as narrator. <br /><br />Female characters fall into one of two categories: either beautiful and voluptuous, with tremulous breasts, shapely calves, and a body suitable for impregnating, or unattractive old women whose haggard appearance deems them unsuitable for bedding. Every sex scene is so awkward, I found myself repeatedly wondering if this book was penned by a virgin. <br /><br />Death is a constant threat - at <i>every</i> turn, for <i>every</i> character - until it bears no gravity. <br /><br />Zaf\u00f3n: *mentions death*<br />Me: *rolls eyes, yawns* <br /><br />The opening pages had me worried, because of one particular detail - <i>one detail</i> - that told me this would be a book I wasn't liable to get along with. I should have heeded my intuition and saved myself eighteen grueling hours of slogging through this tiresome audiobook. The opening scene that planted the first seed of concern: <br /><blockquote>\n  <i>On that June morning, I woke up screaming at first light. My heart was pounding in my chest as if it feared that my soul wanted to carve its way out and run off down the stairs. My father hurried into my room and he held me in his arms, trying to calm me. <br /><br />[. . .] We looked at each other in the half-light, searching for words that didn't exist. For the first time, I realized my father was growing old. He stood up and drew the curtains to let in the pale glint of dawn. <br /><br />\"Come, Daniel, get dressed. I want to show you something,\" he said. <br /><br />\"Now? At five o'clock in the morning?\"</i>\n</blockquote><br />I ask you, when has a child ever been aware of, or concerned with, what time in the morning they've woken their parents? That line reeks of contrived drama. <br /><br />I wanted to like this book, truly, but it wasn't the right fit for me. Between the bloated writing, sexism, and exhausting abundance of drama, reaching the final page was an absolute chore.",

The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it.\"</i>\n</b><br /><br /><br />In post-civil war Barcelona, ten-year-old birthday boy, Daniel Sempere is taken by his father to a top-secret, labyrinthine library called 'The Cemetery of Forgotten Books' and is asked to select whichever one of the dusty publications calls out to him from an exhaustive succession of shelves.<br />He chooses an obscure novel, <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i> written by the enigmatic Juli\u00e1n Carax, an author whose life and work is shrouded in dark mystery.<br /><br />Over time, the book awakens this socially awkward boy to fresh possibilities and new friendships in a city still handcuffed to its recent history. Daniel, himself, describes the novel thus: \"It is a story of love, of hatred and of the dreams that live in the shadow of the wind.\"<br /><br />In the honeymoon period of my read I was already thinking it to be one of the best books I'd picked up in a very long time and, after a handful of chapters, I was wishing that Goodreads would allow 5-star-plus ratings for special books such as this.<br />The author's character imagery is up there with M\u00e1rquez and Rushdie (it has the comportment of magical realism, but both feet are set firmly in the realism camp). The story has heart and soul and it nobly champions the underdog in an unjust world. Look out for nasty piece of work, Chief Inspector Francisco Javier Fumero, he of the pencil moustache and greasy grin; very much the <i>b\u00eate noire</i> of the piece.<br />Z\u00e1fon's expressive prose and finespun storytelling held me in a dizzy state of veneration and had me purring in my armchair like a pampered pussycat.<br />But, oh!<br />Alas, damnation and gadzooks! <br />Did you hear me? \"Gadzooks,\" I said!! <br />The author somehow snatches defeat from the jaws of victory by allowing his dazzling story to become bogged down by a warehouse load of wearisome narrative in the middle orders of the piece.<br />\"Get on with it, Z\u00e1fon!\" I shouted.<br />(He didn't hear me).<br /><br />And where's a book defibrillator when you need one? <br /><br />It's a real shame because this book is infused with brilliance; Carlos Ruiz Z\u00e1fon is incontestably touched by greatness.<br />In my humble opinion, this magical rites-of-passage/good-versus-evil sprawl of a novel would have easily merited that notional 5-star-plus rating, were it not for the drawn-out tedium of its meandering epicentre. Editing out a hundred or more pages would've done this a power of good.<br />I'm still awarding it 4.5, rounded up to 5. Its sublimity outweighs its imperfections.<br /><br />And listen up, my Goodreads' brothers, sisters, funsters, pseuds, bibliophiles and <i>savants.</i><br />Daniel Sempere's book epiphany is one which will resonate with each and every one of you.<br />For each of us, there is one book that has been waiting for us from before we were born.<br />I wonder which one is yours? : )",

At the same time, I want to shout from the rooftops about how good this book is. So here I am.<br /><br />This book is the perfect mix of dark brooding mystery with a wistful romance and a melancholy, bookish main character. There's so many elements that are effortlessly held afloat by the gorgeous, melodic, and yet digestible writing. I tabbed the everloving sunshine out of this book because there's so many astute and haunting lines; Zaf\u00f3n is truly a talented writer who I certainly see myself reading more from. <br /><br />My only issue throughout the book was the way the mystery unfolded, but it was more of a user error because I took so long to read this book that between sittings, I would forget all the details about which character is who. Also, the perspective jumping from character to character could be a bit startling, but by the end of this book when I spent the last 50 pages sobbing and hugging my cat as I read on, I couldn't give a single damn about this minor storytelling blip. <br /><br />Very few books earn the title of a masterpiece from me, but this is one of them. It takes you on a complete journey with characters so lifelike and human, eccentric and lovely, twisted and vile. I foresee this being a book that, when I pass it in a book shop, I will stroke its spine lovingly and remember the hours I spent cuddled with it, lost in its alternating gloomy and hopeful moods.",

Faced by this strange and dark person from the shadows, Daniel refuses to give up or sell the book and so a ten-year journey begins and a literary hunt for the Carax\u2019s story and those he loved and lost. The story takes us to Barcelona, into towering mansions and eerie back-streets, and to Paris where Carax wrote most of his novels whilst longing for his lost love, and then back to Spain for the climatic ending. <br /><br />Review and Comments <br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is an impressively accomplished and stunning novel that captures your imagination and carries you through a story or passion and hatred, of heart and soul, of beauty and of longing with an abundance of anticipation, adventure and thrill as Daniel seeks to discover the life and story behind the author Carax. <br /><br />The standout quality of the book has to be the authors writing style and his extraordinary command over language. There is a dreamlike quality to the writing, that was so enchanting and beautiful, I felt totally captivated and almost bewitched by the story and trapped inside the world the author created for us. <br /><br />However, the attributes of the book don\u2019t stop there, the characters are superb, so well developed and compelling, that they come alive in the storytelling and with well-crafted dialogue. The plot is superb, however, if there was one negative to add, the flow of the book and structure of the book was not perfect in my opinion because it wasn\u2019t always clear who was narrating the story. Yet any negative is certainly overshadowed by the book\u2019s brilliance, the soul and enchanting but heart-breaking story linking two generations.<br /><br />I love the quote, <i>\u201cbooks are like mirrors, you only see in them what you already have inside you\u201d</i><br /><br />I could not recommend highly enough.

The characters offer depth and range, and you\u2019re not quite sure what intentions are genuine and where your sympathies will lie at the end. The hot, misty, atmospheric Barcelona is exceptionally well characterised and seems to seep through the skin, which adds to the mood of suspense and mystery.<br /><br />A masterpiece and one of my favourite books of all time.

Narrated by a young Daniel Sempere, it chronicles his transformation from a child to a young man in a Francoist post-war Spain, his loves and obsessions, his brushes with the world of mysteries and reality - both of these worlds equally dangerous and fascinating. But Daniel is really a medium through which we learn the heart and soul of this book - the story of Juli\u00e1n Carax, a man who wrote a book that finds its way into Daniel's life, a man whose past and present shape the course of all the events in this narrative, Juli\u00e1n Carax who seems to be the embodiment of both driving force and destructive force in the pages of this novel.<blockquote>\n  <i>\u201cThere are few reasons for telling the truth, but for lying the number is infinite.\u201d</i>\n</blockquote>This book left me in an enchanted daze, and I'm still struggling to figure out why or how. What was it exactly that made it so easy for me to overlook the imperfections and blemishes of this story - the not-uncommon sexist male gaze, the telenovela-like melodramatic developments, the sometimes strange choices of inserting exposition into the narrative flow.<blockquote>\n  <i>\"A story is a letter that the author writes to himself, to tell himself things that he would be unable to discover otherwise.\"</i>\n</blockquote>And the only answers I can find are these - it was the fantastic engrossing atmosphere and the sincere unabashed love of literature, combined with the language that sings to you in all its exuberant beauty.<br><br>The atmosphere is built on a classic Gothic setting. The foreboding darkness haunts the story, complete with foreshadowings, strange haunted old mansions, dark secrets waiting to be unearthed, feverish passions and dark past tormenting the characters, emotional epistolary confessions, menacing villains, and dark stormy nights in abundance. Shadows are everywhere, and things lurk in them, be sure of that. And destiny seems to reach in with its meddling hand and place things in necessary to it order. And the tortured, passionate love stories - oh yes, they are here, too.<blockquote>\n  <i>\"Memories are worse than bullets.\u201d</i>\n</blockquote>And yet the framing setting of 1950s grounds the Gothic atmosphere, forces it into reality. And the pervasive sharp humor makes the story quite self-aware of its own stylized nature, making the elements that can easily turn annoying into fascinating bits instead.<blockquote>\n  <i>\"Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.\"</i>\n</blockquote>Daniel, a son of a bookshop owner, has a special connection with books - after all, he was introduced by his father to the mysterious place known as Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a place in the heart of Barcelona where abandoned books are stored, a place from where he is allowed to 'adopt' a book - and what calls to him is the book by an obscure writer Juli\u00e1n Carax, a Barcelonian himself, a man long-dead, a man whose remaining books are hunted and burned by a mysterious stranger. <blockquote>\n  <i>\"I began to believe that Juli\u00e1n was not a man, he was an illness.\"</i>\n</blockquote>It's Juli\u00e1n Carax, his elusive past and present, the enigma that surrounds the man and is impossible for Daniel to resist that form the cornerstone, the centerpiece of this novel. Juli\u00e1n, a tragic hero of the Gothic novel, whose life and character are slowly revealed bit by bit, until you realize you are just as enchanted with him as the people who have met him seem to be - and all that without Juli\u00e1n ever making an appearance himself. And by the time we see the warning signs of Juli\u00e1n's single-minded destructive obsession, it is too late to turn back, and we begin to understand the strange obsession with him that more than one character carries.<blockquote>\n  <i>\"There are worse prisons than words.\"</i>\n</blockquote>This book is an example of the journey, not the destination. The plot twists are not pivotal. The reveals that come are not that important, and there are plenty of clues for the reader to come to the conclusions well before they are revealed. <br><br><b>What is important, however, is allowing yourself to step into the world Zaf\u00f3n creates, into the early- and mid-century Barcelona, under the shadow of gothic buildings, into the world that no longer exists.</b><br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682486535i/34182551.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Lovely, lovely book; not perfect but engrossing and beautiful, and well-deserving of the attention it has received.

I don't know how easy it is for y'all to access the record of those here on Goodreads, but if you're looking for a detailed account of my thoughts on the book, you can look there.<br /><br />I'll say this. I've read a lot of books to my little boy these last couple years, and I can honestly say that This book is among the best. Good, tight writing, good description. Good action. Also there's not a lot of dead space or trashy empty dialogue that just seems to be there to take up space. (That's become a particular peeve lately. And when you're reading a book aloud, it becomes really obvious.) <br /><br />The British slang will be a stumbling block to some. But it's not too bad. And there were a few slight pieces of sexism that I ignored, skipped over, or re-worded on the fly. But honestly, this book was written 60 years ago, and you need to cut it a little slack because of that. And in my opinion, it only needs a little slack. Truth be told, I've read books written this year that have ten times the sexism this one does. <br /><br />Also, I'd like to make it clear that this is the FIRST book of the Narnia Chronicles. This is where you start the series. I'm sorry if you read them in the wrong order, but if you did, it's better than you admit it now, come to grips, and move on with your life knowing the truth.",

    "text": "<b>\n  <i>\u201cIf ever they remembered their life in this world it was as one remembers a dream.\u201d </i>\n</b><br><br>The real world is boring; it\u2019s mundane, unimaginative and dry. So humans create fantasy as a means of escape. We watch movies or go to the theatre to see something more interesting than the standard realities of the everyday. We paint pictures and gaze up at the stars. We play video games and roleplay. We dream. Authors like C.S Lewis and J.K Rowling show us this miserable world; they show us its tones of grey. Then underneath it all they reveal something spectacular: they reveal fantasy. <br><br>So we have four rather ordinary children about to embark on an extraordinary adventure. As a child I used to always daydream. I\u2019ve always been somewhat introverted and would prefer imagining faraway places than existing in the now. I still do this as an adult. And this is why I love fantasy so much because it is so immersive; it literally takes my mind away. Lucy, Susan, Edward and Peter are the lucky ones. When they stumble across the wardrobe, the gateway into a more interesting realm, they experience something spectacular. <br><br><i>\u201cShe did not shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.\u201d </i><br><br> <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1482775348ra/21547735.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><br>Sure, there\u2019s a war going on. And, certainly, there\u2019s an evil witch going around murdering people. But, for me, that\u2019d be a price worth paying. For in Narnia there is also Aslan and a whole bunch of interesting characters. There is hope, magic and companionship. The wise old Aslan though is the star of the show. He sacrifices himself for his friends, for his people. Though one issue I have with the book, and one that makes me very much aware of the text as a construct, is the questions over why Aslan actually needed to the four children. He pretty much deals with the problems by himself. There\u2019s prophecy involved, but on a plot level he clearly could have sorted this mess out without any outside interference. <br><br>I\u2019ve seen a lot of hate over these books because of the Christian allegories involved in the storytelling. Now I find this somewhat stupid. I\u2019m not a Christian, far from it, but you can\u2019t really criticise a book because of this. It\u2019s incredibly na\u00efve. It would be like judging <i>Jane Eyre </i> based on its feminism aspects or Shakespeare\u2019s exploration of colonialism in <i> The Tempest. </i>It\u2019s silly. This book is, undeniable, full of Christian dogmatism. But it\u2019s what the author wanted it to be. If you read Tolkien\u2019s work there are so many allusions the world wars; this doesn\u2019t affect the overall storytelling. It\u2019s simply what is there. Read this with an open mind, as an English Literature student, I read the bible. I don\u2019t believe the words inside, but I can still enjoy the experience. And this story is no different. Take it for what it is. <br><br><i>\u201cWrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,<br>At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,<br>When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,<br>And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.\u201d </i><br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1482775651ra/21547788.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><br>And that\u2019s something special. I do, however, much prefer the works of Tolkien. I feel that his writing is more universal in terms of age audience. With this though, I\u2019m very much aware of it as a children\u2019s book. The prose is designed to sound like a children\u2019s bedtime story in places. That\u2019s not exactly a bad thing though. I love Narnia but I can, at least from my perspective, objectively say that Tolkien was a better writer. Though what Narnia does have is Aslan. It\u2019s hard not to Aslan. Wouldn\u2019t it be just wonderful if he met Gandalf? Could you imagine the stories those two could share?

    "text": "My greatest disappointment in <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4000436\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">'The Screwtape Letters'</a> was that Lewis was not able to demonstrate what made his good people good or his bad people bad. The closest he got to defining goodness was that you could tell the good people from the vague aura of light that surrounded them--and which even shone in their cat. In this book, the cat is much bigger.<br /><br />Aslan had no character, he was just a big, dull stand-in. Lewis often tells us how great he is, but never demonstrates what it is that makes him great or impressive. Sure, he helps the kids, but all that makes him is a plot facilitator. He also has his big Jesus moment, but that has the same problem as the original: if he already knows that there will be no lasting negative outcome, how much of a sacrifice is it, really?<br /><br />But then, Aslan isn't based on the original fig-cursing, church-rejecting, rebel Jesus, but the whitewashed version. Like Mickey Mouse, Jesus started out as an oddball troublemaker with his fair share of personality, but becoming the smiling face of a multinational organization bent on world domination takes a lot out of a mascot, whether your magic castle is in California or Rome.<br /><br />Such a visible figure must become universally appealing, universally friendly and loving, lest some subset of followers feel left out. And it's this 'Buddy Christ' tradition from which Aslan springs. Devoid of insight, wisdom, or charm, Aslan is just here to do all the things that our protagonists can't do.<br /><br />This also beggars the question: why didn't Aslan just take care of all this stuff long before the kids arrived? Why did all the animals and fairies and giants have to suffer the pain of an endless winter? We're never given any good reason Aslan had to wait for the kids--since in the end, he does it all on his own, anyways. Sure, Lewis mentions something vague about a prophecy, but in fantasy, prophecy is always a bandaid authors stick over their plot holes: <i>'Uh, the shlubby nobody is a hero because the prophecy says he is--he defeats the ultimate evil because the prophecy says he can'</i>. <br /><br />The only thing the kids do is help run the battle, but this is only necessary because Aslan is absent, and he's only absent because the kids screwed up, meaning the entire thing would have gone off without a hitch if they had never showed up in the first place.<br /><br />In that regard, I have to say Lewis did an excellent job boiling down Christianity into a fable, and leaving the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRTS_yM89gE\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">problem of evil</a> completely intact. Some readers suggest that Aslan lets the queen take over to teach the kids a lesson, but is it really worthwhile to let all the inhabitants of a kingdom suffer a century of misery just to teach a few kids about the true meaning of friendship?<br /><br />The villain is just as poorly-constructed, and seems less concerned with defeating her enemies than with being pointlessly capricious. She manages to trick one of the children, but instead of taking advantage of this fact, she immediately makes it clear that she tricked him. I mean, how did someone that incompetent take over in the first place?<br /><br />Selectively stupid characters are silly and convenient, especially as villains, because this completely undermines their role as foil. It is impressive when characters overcome challenges, but not when challenges simply crumble before them. The children are lucky the Queen was more of a <a href=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/fart.html#devil\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">fart-stealing Old Nick</a> than a Miltonian Satan, otherwise they never would have stood a chance.<br /><br />It is interesting to look at how many Christian authors have tried to reconcile their faith with complex fairy mythologies; not that Christianity doesn't have its own <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_tobit\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">magical fairy tales</a>, but these other traditions are not exactly compatible. Dante has Virgil lead him through hell, the Buddha was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barlaam_and_Josaphat\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">made into a saint</a>, holidays were given new meanings (even if they often kept <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%92ostre\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">old symbols and names</a>), and magical monsters were also given a place in the new faith.<br /><br />In the Middle Ages, monks compiled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastiary\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">'Bestiaries'</a>, which described the roles of dragons, unicorns, and real animals in Christian synbolism; there were even century-spanning debates about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynocephaly#Late_Antiquity\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">whether dog-headed men were descended from Adam</a>. These books were rarely accurate, but allowed Christian theology to adopt many stories and superstitions from earlier periods; for instance, the connection between unicorns and virginity or the belief that pelicans fed their own blood to their young, in imitation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">communion</a>.<br /><br />So Lewis' attempt to take myth and adapt it to a Christian cosmology is hardly new--there is a long and storied tradition explored throughout the Chivalric period and recognizable today in books like <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43545.The_Once_and_Future_King\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Once and Future King</a>, but Lewis doesn't do a very good job of reconciling these disparate mythologies.<br /><br />Like most Protestants, Lewis' religion was a modern one--not magical and mystical, but reasonable and utilitarian. He did not draw on the elaborate, convoluted apocrypha of hallucinatory monsters and miracles that mystics obsess over, instead, he made a small, sane, reasonable magical world--which rather defeats the point. It is unfortunate that many of today's readers think of Lewis' writings as defining English fairy tales, since his late additions to the genre are not original, nor are they particularly well-executed examples.<br /><br />Many authors have come to the genre with much more imagination, a deeper sense of wonder, and a more far-reaching exploration of magic. We have examples from <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/571197.Puck_of_Pook_s_Hill\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Kipling</a>, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24213.Alice_s_Adventures_in_Wonderland_Through_the_Looking_Glass\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Lewis Carroll</a>, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14686\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dunsany</a>, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13624.The_Worm_Ouroboros\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Eddison</a>, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189746\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Morris</a>, and even modern updates by <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16793.Stardust\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Gaiman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14201\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Clarke</a>. Lewis, like Tolkien, may be a well-known example, but both are rather short-sighted, and neither one achieves as much as the many talented authors who came before.<br /><br />I'm not saying Lewis is bad, merely that he is unremarkable, and is hardly preeminent in fantasy, or even in children's fantasy. However, I do think his fundamental message is a bad one, even if he didn't realize he was creating it. <br /><br />In all his worlds, all his stories, he takes the sorts of people he dislikes, defines them as 'evil', then sets himself apart from them. There is no attempt to comprehend or to come to mutual understanding. I cannot respect a book which encourages people to vilify what they don't understand and to call isolation righteous. If any worldview deserves the epithet of 'evil', it is the sort of willful, prideful, self-indulgent ignorance Lewis displays.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://starsbeetlesandfools.blogspot.com/2012/06/suggested-readings-in-fantasy.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">My List of Suggested Fantasy Books</a>",

Within 20 pages, we have been introduced to Narnia which was a welcome relief after reading too many books with extremely long ramp up periods. The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe also knows how to stir the emotions and perfectly described the feelings of disappointment when one of the characters told the truth only to be devastated when her family member does not back her up. <br /><br />There were some repeat characters from the first book; however, I just did not get enough of the Witch. She says things that are laugh out loud funny. In contrast with The Magician's Nephew, this book did not seem as well written as the first. The first book was not as predictable as this one, and I found it more interesting. This book read more like a feel-good family story. Also, The Magician's Nephew has in my opinion one of the most memorable endings ever written.

A whole lotta nostalgia going on.<br /><br />Why am I watching it right now?<br /><br />Well, I just finished a reread of the book, and it is simply as magical as I remember. It is a well written fantasy story that is not too complex and, therefore, is accessible to young and old alike. It does indeed have Christian allegory, but it is up to you whether you want to read it with that in mind or not. <br /><br />One thing about the dialogue is that while it is simple, there are some words and phrases that are dated to the time period it was written. Because of this, a dictionary may be helpful every so often throughout the book. One place where Google came in quite handy was in the chapter about Turkish Delight. It might have been more common long ago or in other parts of the world, but I was not quite sure what it is.<br /><br />Finally, the best part of this reread was that I read it out loud to my 7 and 5 year old. It feels great to pass great books on to them. Also, it was magical to watch how much they enjoyed it. They we're even drawing pictures of the characters and running around the house pretending to look for the wardrobe!<br /><br />Side note: some versions of the series have this as the first book. Some have it as the second. Even though I have read them all before, I don't really have an opinion on the matter. I think either order is just fine.",

And, friends, I fell so in love. I actually think I\u2019m going to make it a holiday tradition to read this book every single December for the rest of my life. <br><br>And it was so funny, because I was very apprehensive going in, because when I was little, I think the religious themes went over my head, but I didn\u2019t know how overbearing they would be reading this story for the first time as an adult. But it honestly wasn\u2019t too much. I mean, some of the characters in Narnia refer to the kids as \u201cSon of Adam\u201d and \u201cDaughter of Eve\u201d and like I get the parallels with Aslan and Jesus now! But I still think it was very thoughtfully done and didn\u2019t pull me out of the story or anything like that. <br><br>But if you are unfamiliar with this beloved children\u2019s tale, this is a story about four children who have been recently adopted by an old professor who lives in a massive house. And one rainy day, while the kids are bored, they decide to explore the house that is now their new home. And the youngest of the children find a portal to a magical land, ruled by the White Witch, who is causing an endless winter. <br><br>\u27bd <b>Lucy</b> - The Best Character.<br>\u27bd <b>Edmund</b> - What A Little Shit.<br>\u27bd <b>Peter</b> - Good Guy.<br>\u27bd <b>Susan</b> - Group Mom.<br>\u27bd <b>Aslan</b> - Simba Who? <br>\u27bd <b>Tumnus</b> - Second Fave, Even Though He Almost Kidnapped My First Fave.<br><br>But there was so much that I forgot about this story: Mr. Beaver poppin\u2019 open a cold one at dinner, Tumnus almost kidnapping Lucy, Everything the professor says to the kids and how he helps them, Edmund being the such a little shit that even my patience was getting tested, Turkish Delights, Father Christmas, and him giving the kids weapons as gifts! <br><br>Overall, this was just the perfect winter wonderland to me. From closet, to lamppost, to dam, to forest, to castle, I never wanted to leave this adventure. I am not sure if it is a lot of nostalgia talking, but this was maybe the best thing I read all holiday season. It was exactly what I wanted, and I was truly enthralled from the first to last page.

I don't like C.S Lewis's non fiction books, but here he knocked the ball out of the park.<br /><br />Aslan, whose antics and decision making and beliefs are difficult to map, is the way by which the children triumph. If Alice in Wonderland was positively secular, TLTWaTW is heavily defined by the Christian mythos.<br /><br />There are many shining examples of pause to let the tension play out, before a little more of the adventure is revealed. Curiously, along with wonder, it is with the realization that I read this book. It's very much Anglo Saxon in nature, yet it lends itself to translation so easily. It's a book that does not belong to any age, decade, or era. <br /><br />It's a little wonder of writing. The figures agree with me: This book is apparently one of the top 10 bestselling books of all time.",

    "text": "Although raised as a Christian, I've long been an atheist and perhaps that's partly why I'm uncomfortable with this retelling of the life of Jesus as Aslan the lion. I have no objection to Bible stories as part of our culture and heritage, but this is more underhand.<br><br>As a child, I loved this series, even when I learned the metaphor. That was probably partly a reflection of my mother's enthusiasm, and it insulated me from the guilt and horror that some of the commenters below felt about Aslan's sacrifice.<br><br>Then I read it to my own child. I was increasingly uncomfortable, and fortunately, kiddo wasn't interested in my reading the rest of the series to them. It is too preachy, and the way Mr Tumnus lures Lucy to his lair doesn't feel right, despite his upstanding character. Nevertheless, we did see the 2005 film. Mr Tumnus was SO human - and naked (except for a little scarf) - from the waist up, that his taking Lucy home seemed even worse than on the page.

We would all come in from lunch and our teacher would read to us for about 30 minutes before we would start class.<br /> I remember this book because it wasnt read to us by Mrs Graham, but instead it would be read by Mr Goodwin, her long-haired, bearded, Birkenstock wearing teacher's aid. <br /> Over the next few weeks we were enthralled by this story, we couldnt wait for lunch period to be over so we could hear what was happening in this magic kingdom, called Narnia.<br /> From the begining we all identified with Lucy and her siblings. How was it possible that an English girl could transport herself to another place, simply by hiding in a wardrobe? And once through the wardrobe, there was this wonderful and friendly creature called a faun, Mr Tumnus. All this in only the first chapter.<br /> As the chapters progressed we got to know more about the siblings and the other creatures who inhabit Narnia.<br /> Some people critisize C.S Lewis for using too much Christian symbolism, but I was in 4th grade and to me this was the most wonderful and exciting book ever written for children. <br /> <br /> When Mr Goodwin finished the book. I instantly went to the library so I could read it myself. I was very proud this was the first book I read \"without pictures\". To my joy, I discovered there were other books about Narnia and I eventually read all of them too. Evenutually I discovered other wonderful places in other books and I continue to look for them today.<br /> I will always be grateful to Mr Goodwin, he started off by telling me about Narnia, but in the end, he introduced me to so much more through my on going love of books.<br /> Thank you Mr Goodwin, for everything.<br /> ",

    "text": "<b>A Defence of C.S. Lewis...or a brief attempt at such</b><br /><br />Some thoughts recently crossed my mind in regards to arguments one could offer as a defence of the Christian side of this novel. The main arguments against this novel as a 'Christian allegory' that I have heard are: 1)Aslan is not a strong Christ-figure 2)That C.S. Lewis 'preaches' a black and white morality. So I'm going to roughly address them from my perspective and hope it encourages some discussion.<br /><br />1) I will agree that Aslan is not a strong Christ-figure. Firstly for Aslan to really represent Christ he would have to be true to the gospel story. In other words he would have to be god made into man come to die for all mankind. However as he only dies for the one traitor again it's not sticking true to the Biblical gospel that all have sinned and that Christ was needed as a sacrifice for that sin. If you take things too literally here, C.S. Lewis' novel doesn't make much that much sense theologically as a result. I'll explain where I am/was going with that in a moment.<br /><br />2) I debate that C.S. Lewis preaches in his novel. Occasionally he can be a touch patronising but compared to many authors he rarely slips into such condescension. As for his morality I think you must understand it from the perspective of Christianity. Christianity is about black and white morality essentially: good versus evil, light vs. dark and truth vs. lies etc. It is also very grey in that Christianity is about life and the fact that no one is perfect, that everyone fits into that moral grey area. Of course I explain roughly and inadequately.<br /><br />Ultimately I see that there is room to argue that C.S. Lewis does a poor job of writing an allegorical novel. However I see it as a very subtle novel that unlike others (for instance The Alchemist) does not build its story around expressing an ideology but rather incorporates an ideology into its storytelling. I think that if one wants to criticise this novel it should be for not properly showing the gospel rather than for 'preaching'. I know that I and many others enjoyed the story first before seeing the connection between it and the Biblical tales. I enjoyed it even more afterwards so, then again I could be a tad biased.<br /><br /><b>Original Review</b><br /><br />To begin I must note that I grant this such a high rating due to the impact it had on my life. It to me is one novel that were I to pick the one novel that forged a love of books for me it would be The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Why? Because I can remember back about twelve years ago when I was homeschooled by my mother as a five year old. We wandered down during winter into the warm back room and she read the first Narnia book to us. The image of a red faun carrying parcels as he passed a growing lamppost would stick with me from that moment (as it stuck with C.S. Lewis). As I learned to read the Narnia books were the first novels I sunk my growing reading teeth into. And to this day I have read and re read the novels back to front (and maybe front to back).<br /><br />The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a novel written for both children and adults. It contains highly allegorical elements as C.S.Lewis was a well-known apologetics writer. However he wrote that he did not write his novel as a pure allegory but as a story. And that is what The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is, a story to be enjoyed by everyone. And although written in simple language the reader can quickly, concisely and easily imagine the world without the clumsy constraints of overused words. I personally cannot imagine a world without these novels.<br /><br />Additional thoughts:<br /><br />1. Just a question at last. And one with a highly philosophical twist to it. Why is it that people so readily condemn those books which are considered as moral tales? You'd think we could do with more morality in such a twisted and confused world regardless of accepting the belief systems. <br /><br />2. I have heard many people describe the entire series as silly and far too preachy. I do not see it that way at all. Trust me if C.S.Lewis wanted to be preachy he would have written a lot more philosophy and less story. Yes I can see how some would call this silly but then I argue that they are missing the point. It's a fairytale type fantasy intended mainly for children (and for those children again as adults or for their parents perhaps). But I argue that as Lewis only wrote this story based on the story of the crucifixion in many ways that it was not intended as a preachy book. My question is that why is it that if I were to base a story along what some call the 'Christian myth' it is claimed as preaching while as if I were to base it on any other mythology or story it would be deemed as merely copying the themes of another mythology? Is this yet another example of doublethink?*<br /><br />*See <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/5470.1984\" title=\"1984 by George Orwell\" rel=\"noopener\">1984</a> ",

Or at least, I did. My favorite type of book was fantasy because the heroes and heroines of those books were always shy, awkward children who didn't have a lot of friends, and yet they triumphed in spite of that. In hindsight, that feels a bit exploitative, but child-me at that stuff up without questioning it too deeply. Since I've been in the mother of all book slumps, I figured what better way to get out than by picking up an old favorite, the <i>Narnia </i>series, and breezing through them all?<br><br><br><br>I'm doing this slightly differently and reading them in <i>chronological </i>order rather than publication order, so I actually kicked off this experiment with a book that I hadn't read yet, which was <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2448249462\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW</a>. In publication order, I believe it is book #6, coming just before LAST BATTLE. However, in the chronology of the series, it is actually the \"first.\"<br><br><br><br>THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW is a cool book because it explains the origin of both Narnia and the White Witch, as well as the Professor who agrees to take in the Pevensie children during the chaos of WWII. Reading it just before THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE was a real treat, because where THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW ENDS, THE LION begins, so depending on which series order you choose, it either brings the entire series full circle before ending it OR kicks of the story while treating you, the reader, with insider knowledge that will give you new perspective.<br><br><br><br>Rereading this was pretty great because my mom used to read me this book when I was a kid and still had what could be called a \"nursery.\" I've also watched most of the film adaptations including the 1979 animated version, the 1988 TV movie version from BBC, and then the 2005 version that came out in theaters, hoping to ride on the coattails of the Post Harry Potter fantasy craze. I know my opinion isn't the popular one here, but I actually like the theatrically-released one the least. My favorite will always be the BBC one. It's cheesy and most of the animals are portrayed by people who are <i>obviously </i>wearing animal costumes and makeup, but it gives the movies a weird sort of charm. Plus, the opening music is kick-ass. Nothing like a French horn bugles, THIS IS FANTASY, BITCH.<br><br><br><br>I still liked the book upon rereading it but I definitely noticed a lot of stuff that flew over my head when I was a kid. There are elements of that Cold War paranoia in here (although more so in the prequel, THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW), many Christian allegories to the Bible and Original Sin, and there's also a shocking amount of sexism, with Susan and Lucy being excluded by all of the battles save for a \"cry for help\" or healing capacity, and Santa Claus himself even tells them that wars are uglier when women are involved, whatever <i>that </i>means. Also, Aslan's a judgy f*ck. Don't @ me.<br><br><br><br>This is a very short book and I was kind of surprised by how quickly it was over and how much of a movie they were able to make of it despite that. Some of the scenes have still stuck with me all these years, like Lucy's first tumbling through the Wardrobe, the flight through the cold and snowy forest, the night of the Stone Table, and the hall of the statues where they all come to life - relieving them as an adult is like seeing a double-exposed image; you experience it again as an adult while also remembering your childhood experiences of it with fond nostalgia. The ending always made me sad, because it felt like an allegory for growing up and having to leave fantasy behind.<br><br><br><br>I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this series!<br><br><br><br>3.5 to 4 stars",

    "text": "I\u2019m going to do something I try not to do here, since I consider this to be a site about other people\u2019s words- I\u2019m going to ramble on autobiographically for a bit.<br /><br />I bought this first volume of Dylan\u2019s Chronicles the day it came out in 2004, was anticipating the hell out of it. Back then I was managing a used record store in College Park, Maryland. I studied poetry and creative writing at UMD, big waste of my time, could\u2019ve learned all that on my own, learn more now on my own than I did then anyway, except from maybe two or three professors who had something to say, and besides reading a lot of Shakespeare, it was a big snooze. Though I did find Frank O\u2019Hara and John Ashberry and Fernando Pessoa and I feel like I learned a great deal about ol\u2019 Will\u2019s plays I wouldn\u2019t have come to on my own. Other than that, I should have studied languages or education or linguistics or history or something that could have landed me a better job after I graduated. When I did graduate, the world was so opaque to me I didn\u2019t know how to take the next step. The reality that I considered the adult, professional world to be seemed so dead and vacant to me that I wanted no part of it, but I knew that my consciousness and my conscience were no longer with the style and opinions of my youth. I had always played music, written songs, shitty as they were, and my circle of friends were mostly wanna-be artists and musicians, some skateboarding punks, pot-heads, some real dim and bright lights. I got a job managing a used record store a few of my friends worked at. That way I didn\u2019t have to move home after graduation, could stay around DC, which I loved (coming from a small town in southern Maryland, the DC/Baltimore duality is almost overwhelmingly fertile, experience-wise, especially if you are young and don\u2019t know other cities). So I started working at this record store that was, in retrospect, at the same time the best and the worst decision I could have made.<br /><br />But it suited me because I knew music inside and out. I knew punk, weirdo-rock, jazz, little no name labels, blues, pop, rap, R &amp; B, African music, Brazilian music, folk singers, composers- I had an infinite catalog of songs always running through my head, felt like I knew millions of lyrics by heart, could name jazz artists by the first four or so bars of a tune, dove deep into every style of music. And I was playing music, writing it myself, so it was an ideal situation, but one I still wanted to keep extremely temporary, employment-wise. My favorite bands came out of the 80\u2019s noise scene, SST bands, stuff like Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., Spacemen 3, Pelt, bands like Minor Threat and Fugazi, I got into Pavement because they were like nothing I\u2019d ever heard, I dug The Velvet Underground as much as anyone could, \u201cPale Blue Eyes\u201d still makes me weepy, I loved those strange little short-lived mathematical bands like June of 44, A Minor Forest, Hoover. I also loved jazz, all jazz, from Louis Armstrong to the most wild Albert Ayler tunes, Coltrane, Archie Shepp, Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, the European improvisers of harsh noise like Peter Brotzmann, Mats Gustafsson, especially drummers like Hamid Drake, Paal Nilssen-Love, and the masters like Elvin Jones and Buddy Rich, Philly Joe Jones; the great tenor players Sonny Rollins and Lester Young, and those ethereal beings such as Sun Ra, Bobby Hutcherson, Anthony Braxton, who you couldn\u2019t really define or pin down. I came to exalt Django Reinhardt as if he was the real Jesus, the three-fingered Jesus, more striking and more straight to the point than the other Jesus. I had all kinds of music coursing throughout my entire being, pulsing through me all day, all night, I worshiped these people, had shrines to them, treated vinyl records like idols. I played music all day in the store, just put everything on. Heard so much. Found so many things I would never have known about unless I had those hours to just explore a vast quantity of random records at my leisure. The only stuff I didn\u2019t really get into was the watered-down stuff, the stuff that sounded too polished, too clean, like pretty college boys made it, or like it cost a million dollars to record. Anything gritty, anything that had something a little off to it, something that didn\u2019t quite sit right, that made you wonder just what the hell was up with this person, I could get into. All genres, all types. The common thread was originality and heart, and something mournful or odd about the tune. It wasn\u2019t until those long, strangely-paced hours of digging through the stock of that record store that I came to know Bob Dylan\u2019s music.<br /><br />Dylan had always eluded me, don\u2019t know why, I came to him relatively late in the development of my tastes. I guess it was that I was well-versed in obscurities, but big names of the popular music world seemed instantly repugnant to me; it\u2019s a fault of youth, wanting things to be just for yourself. I just thought that if the masses liked them they couldn\u2019t hold any kind of secret. That the secrets were held by a chosen few, who spoke in tongues, and that those kind of revelations wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t reach a mass audience. The weirder the better, it seemed to me, and the more authentic. So when I put on \u201cThe Times They Are A-Changin\u2019\u201d, I just expected it would be another 40 minute write off. Not that I didn\u2019t know Dylan; you can\u2019t grow up in America and not know the name Bob Dylan. It\u2019s like not knowing the names Abe Lincoln or Lee Harvey Oswald. But I don\u2019t think I had ever seriously listened to one of his records until now, and in retrospect I think that was the singularly best time for me to hear him, maybe the only time up until then that I was ripe to understand what he was doing, the immensity of what he means, as a songwriter, as a cultural figure, as a presence in the American twentieth century. You can\u2019t be a child or of a child-like mind to get Dylan. You have to have experience, you have to have known some kind of pain and loss and redemption of some sort; like the great blues artists- Charlie Patton, Big Bill Broonzy, Leadbelly- you can\u2019t be kidding around and get what these guys are trying to put across.<br /><br />Dylan hit me like a brick in the face. \u201cWith God On Our Side\u201d and \u201cChimes of Freedom\u201d were the first songs I remember being utterly enraptured with and destroyed by from him:<br /><br />\u201cStarry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught<br />Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended<br />As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look<br />Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended<br />Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed<br />For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse<br />An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\u201d<br /><br />\u201cTo Ramona\u201d was perhaps the greatest love song I\u2019d ever personally heard: \u201cThe flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes.\u201d... \u201cCorrina, Corrina\u201d, \u201cGirl of the North Country\u201d, etc., the big ones hit me too, \u201cHard Rain A\u2019Fallin\u2019\u201d, \u201cOnly A Pawn in Their Game\u201d. Those first few acoustic records of his seemed like liquid fire, lightning and stone all at once, all of it telling utterly real and bleak truths. And then I moved on through his catalog. \u201cBringing It All Back Home\u201d and the rock-a-billy blues forms, the humor in the lyrics, the takes they kept of Bob laughing at himself, the searing rhythm of the band, \u201cHighway 61 Revisited\u201d which is probably in the top 5 greatest records ever cut, and on through the weirdness of the early seventies, the mid-seventies masterpieces \u201cPlanet Waves\u201d, \u201cBlood on the Tracks\u201d, \u201cDesire\u201d, and then off into the cosmos of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s when he was throwing all this stuff at the wall to see what would stick, and the eventual renaissance of his late 90\u2019s records and albums from this century, when he really found his form and his tongue again, when you realized he never lost anything but was just out for a long walk... what it was (and this took me a lot of listening to pin down) was that Dylan captured it all, all the influences, all the currents, all the sounds, all the weirdness and nostalgia, the Americana, the high lonesome sound of the mountains as well as the chaos of the city streets, the resonance of the abandoned plains and the reverberation of both ocean coasts, the silence of the hermetic shepherd under the stars and the cockiness of the hard-boiled city kid, the upstart... everything I liked about all the music I had discovered, it all flowed through that great flame of hair, burned in those eyes, seared in that voice and echoed in those plucked strings...<br /><br />I came to say things like \u201cthe Elizabethans had Shakespeare, we have Dylan\u201d and I believe that. Dylan <i>is</i> twentieth century America to me. Somehow it all became amassed in this slight, skinny Jewish kid from the North Country. He seems like the ghost of everyone who ever lived, singing all their laments.<br /><br />So when the first volume of his autobiography came out in 2004 I had my copy set aside at the now long gone but always loved Vertigo Books, and eagerly ran over from the record store to pick it up. But for whatever reason, the first few pages didn\u2019t catch me. I don\u2019t know why. I thought of Dylan as <i>the</i> great artist of our times, of the times preceding mine, of the times to come, and yet, it may have been because of the other reading I was into then (a lot of Joyce, reading and rereading Ulysses), it didn\u2019t grab me. I set it aside. It\u2019s seven years later, I\u2019m working a much better job, just put a record out under my own name, Dylan is still with me as strong as ever, and I\u2019m closing the last page of this remarkable first volume of his memoirs.<br /><br />The book itself is most definitely not only for Dylan aficionados, mostly because so much of what is in the book is Dylan observing the world and times around him, going deep into specifics of memories, fixing time and place by weather, news, architecture, the personalities he encounters, the particularities of the sky and trees, the shadows on streets, the vibe of rooms, the ambience of smoky cramped clubs; basically he writes with an eyes-open style, absorbing the physical world, not self-involved but totally observant. Dylan the man disappears into the spaces he evokes, and then he emerges, startles one with some strange sentence or description, and then the earth is spinning on again, and he is immersed in discourses on folk songs, bars, cities, literature, politics, human nature, history, specifics of music theory, recording techniques, travels; the narrative is utterly non-linear, too; he leaps from memory to memory, associations taking him across decades, and this being the first of what is to be a three volume series, you can see Chronicles becoming this big time, shuffling, always-in-motion mosaic.<br /><br />It\u2019s no surprise that the most literate of song writers loves books so much, and one of the early pleasures in Chronicles is Dylan discovering the books he was to adore, rifling through the libraries of different friends whose couches he happened to be crashing on. Tolstoy, Pushkin, Chekhov, Gogol, Maupassant, Poe, Byron, Shelley, Milton, Ovid; but above all Balzac, Rimbaud, and Baudelaire. (As recently as \u201cLove and Theft\u201d Dylan was still lifting lines like \u201cTime and love has branded me with its claws\u201d, in \u201cPo\u2019 Boy\u201d, straight out of Baudelaire\u2019s \u201cLe Spleen de Paris\u201d). He can\u2019t help but quote Nietzsche and Von Clausewitz and he keeps returning to Kerouac, who he adored as a youth but then came to de-romanticize. Kerouac is to him another emblematic, problematic American figure. He cites Robert Graves\u2019 The White Goddess, and then tells how he eventually met Graves and wanted to ask him all these things about that book, and the poetic muse, but by that time he had forgotten everything about it.<br /><br />Dylan came from Duluth, near where Highway 61, the main thoroughfare of the country-blues, begins, near where the Mississippi River starts, the cold North, steel country, where foghorns blast over Lake Superior, almost mythical territory in itself, and it is in the mythos of America, the mythical Americana of the twentieth century, that Dylan immerses himself, his music, and his recollections- the America of radio plays, general stores, one-room schoolhouses, frost-hewn meadows, coal mines, church bells, patriotic heroes and heroic villains, cowboys and bank robbers and sheriffs and train jumpers, county fairs, Woody Guthrie-esque wandering minstrels above all else, delta blues men and call and response holler sessions- even if you don\u2019t love Dylan, Chronicles is a gigantic, rich, full catalog of all of this kind of lore. One of his song writing techniques in the early Greenwich Village days was to spend hours in the New York Public Library, reading endless newspapers from the 1850\u2019s and 1860\u2019s, picking up random, strange, peculiar stories about the daily life of antebellum Americans. All of that shows in his early songs, and it shows in the particular distance he kept from the movements and currents of his own times- when the entire 60\u2019s youth culture was demanding him to take a stand and be their voice and leader, he could not have felt less in common with them; characters like Stagger Lee and Ulysses S. Grant were more of his peers and contemporaries than the hippies marching on Washington or at Woodstock. His reality was formed by folk songs, which were formed by the lingering smoke of history and personal experience. He was to take those folk forms and blow them all to pieces, make them more than contemporary or futuristic, was to mold something completely new and different from that material, but the American past and American folk stories are the generating point of all he did or has ever done, and the fashions and causes of the times only seem like drops in the great ocean of history he was drawing on.<br /><br />Beyond all of this, Dylan can write prose very well, very interestingly, and in a style that is all his own. If you have heard Theme Time Radio Hour or any recent interview, that is the voice of this book- the blown out, craggy, father-time voice that sounds and talks like it is centuries old, like a petrified forest's would be. The strange rhythms of his speaking voice are not lost in his sentence structure, neither is his ability as a striking wordsmith. On New Orleans:<br /><br />\u201cThe city is a very long poem... Everything in New Orleans is a good idea. Bijou Temple-type cottages and lyric cathedrals side by side. Houses and mansions, structures of wild grace. Italianate, Gothic, Romanesque, Greek Revival standing in a long line in the rain. Roman Catholic art. Sweeping front porches, turrets, cast-iron balconies, colonnades- thirty-foot columns, gloriously beautiful- double pitched roofs, all the architecture of the whole wide world and it doesn\u2019t move. In New Orleans you could almost see other dimensions. There\u2019s only one day at a time here, then it\u2019s tonight and then tomorrow will be today again.\u201d<br /><br />On Johnny Cash:<br /><br />\u201c...ten thousand years of culture fell from him. He could have been a cave dweller. He sounds like he\u2019s a the edge of a fire, or in the deep snow, or in a ghostly forest...\u201d<br /><br />On Dave Van Ronk:<br /><br />\u201cEvery night I felt like I was sitting at the feet of a timeworn monument... his voice was like rusted shrapnel.\u201d<br /><br />On an 8 second, 8mm film clip of Robert Johnson:<br /><br />\u201cHe\u2019s playing with huge, spider-like hands and they magically move over the strings of his guitar. There\u2019s a harp rack with a harmonica around his neck. He looks nothing like a man of stone, no high-strung temperament. He looks almost child-like, an angelic looking figure, innocent as can be. He\u2019s wearing a white linen jumper, coveralls and an unusual gilded cap like Little Lord Fauntleroy. He looks nothing like a man with the hellhound on his trail. He looks immune to human dread and you stare at the image in disbelief.\u201d<br /><br />I particularly like \u201cstructures of wild grace\u201d and \u201cnothing like a man with the hellhound on his trail\u201d. Chronicles is full of this kind of stuff. If you have any notion of or interest in the history or the music of what is called Americana, of everything us Americans here in the United States are culturally perched upon in the twenty-first century, this first volume of Dylan\u2019s memoirs seems like a proper portal that can lead you to into its great depths; it\u2019s fascinating and I can\u2019t wait for the next volumes.",

    "text": "<b>STRANGE BEDFELLOWS, OR, HOW ALEXANDER THEROUX GOT BOB DYLAN HIS FIFTH STAR BACK</b><br /><br />When I read <i>Chronicles</i> for the first time I was knocked out and gave it five sparkling stars. (My original rave review is way down below.) Then something untoward happened and I came slouching back to Goodreads with an update :<br /><br />\"Conscience impels me to remove one star from my original 5. I'm bewitched, bothered and bewildered.<br /><br />When this gorgeously written, completely eccentric and endearing memoir came out in 2004 I loved it. In the years since then, Dylan fans and commentators have been finding out stuff, and it opens a big can of worms, the worms of PLAGIARISM.<br /><br />Because, it seems, if the rabid batgooglers and archive monkeys are to be believed, large parts - maybe all - of Chronicles are not original writing by Bob Dylan at all but an original mosaic of other people's phrases stitched together by Bob Dylan.\"<br /><br /><br />There\u2019s a sample list of plagiarised passages below along with my less than complimentary rueful conclusion that Chronicles is indeed a work of plagiarism.<br /><br />But now, a further twist!<br />Reading Steven Moore\u2019s love letter to Alexander Theroux I found this on page 27. Bear with me, you have to read a paragraph from <i>Darconville\u2019s Cat</i>, Theroux\u2019s big novel :<br /><br /><i>\u201cStories to delight your ears, favors to allure your eyes? She touched you here and there? Oh yes. The adverse party, with a suitable amount of proleptic irony, was your advocate. But the time that went by! Is it any wonder that Vulcan fashioned creaking shoes for Venus that he might hear her when she stirred?\u201d Crucifer swept his arm from him. \u201cShe loved you \u2013 pish! She was loyal \u2013 bubble! Fair proportioned \u2013 mew! Gentle of heart \u2013 wind!\u201d</i><br /><br />Then Steven says:<br /><br /><i>This sounds like Crucifer\u2019s usual conversation, and yet, hardly a word is his own. The first two sentences are from Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cPassionate Pilgrim\u201d, the third from Shakespeare\u2019s sonnet 35; the Vulcan reference from an unidentified source, probably also Elizabethan, and the final four exclamatory sentences adapted from John Marston\u2019s play \u201cThe Malcontent\u201d (1604). In once sense Darconville\u2019s Cat is a collage of texts, hundreds of quotations and allusions strung together as a narrative, a necklace of literary pearls. Even the final sentence of the novel, \u201cSorrow is the cause of immortal conceptions\u201d, is an unacknowledged quotation from \"The Confessions of Edward Dahlberg\"</i><br /><br />Well now. What\u2019s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.<br /><br />Goose = Alexander Theroux<br /><br />Gander = Bob Dylan<br /><br />We will no longer call <i>Chronicles</i> a dodgy plagiarised memoir stuffed full of unacknowledged ripoffs of dozens of other authors, we will call it a collage of texts, hundreds of quotations and allusions strung together as a narrative, a necklace of literary pearls.<br /><br />**<br /><br /><b>SOME PARTS OF CHRONICLES FORMERLY DESCRIBED AS PLAGIARISED</b><br /><br />I quote from some of these findings on the Untold Dylan website :<br /><br /><i>Really the Blues</i> (1946) by Mezz Mezzrow and Bernard Wolfe<br /><i>Baby this that powerful man with that good grass that'll make you tip through the highways and byways like a Maltese kitten. Mezz, this is my new dinner and she's a solid viper. </i><br /><br />And now, part of Dylan's description of his friend Ray's girl, Chloe Kiel:<br /><br /><i>She was cool as pie, hip from head to toe, a Maltese kitten, a solid viper \u2014 always hit the nail on the head. I don't know how much weed she smoked, but a lot. </i> (Chronicles, p. 102)<br /><br />And later in <i>Really the Blues</i>, a black man was \"sitting there actually talking to a white woman cool as pie.\"<br /><br />Really The Blues, page 241:<br /><br /><i>I never tried to make a real business out of the gauge, but the demand for it just sprang up by itself, and even after giving the other guys their cut I always had a couple of hundred bucks come the end of the week.

They found dozens of phrases from a single issue of Time magazine April 1961 embedded in Dylan's text - clearly he wanted to give a lot of pungent contemporary detail in his memories of Greenwich Village and instead of doing what most writers would do, soaking himself in the writings of the time &amp; then writing his own account in his own words, he assembled his memoir by taking the phrases he liked verbatim.<br /><br />Plagiarism I think is legally defined as consisting of seven words in an identical sequence, and I don't think Bob ever does precisely that, so, legally, maybe, he isn't a plagiarist. But it sure feels like he is.<br /><br />I loved this book and I'm quite shaken up to find out all this stuff. Rabid Dylan fans are brushing the whole thing aside, saying oh well, if you scrutinised any book by anyone else as much as Chronicles has been you'd find the same. But that's just insane, of course you wouldn't. Now what are we to think of these \"borrowings\"? I know that borrowing and revising tunes and song lyrics is standard practice in folk and blues music, and Dylan has done plenty of that, quite openly, as have others. That doesn't bother me. But in a sustained piece of prose that is not meant to be sung or played, but taken as the author's own composition, it is not standard practice. In the instances given above, I think Bob comes pretty close to real plagiarism, and for all I know there are more instances in Chronicles yet to be identified. Frankly, as a Dylan fan from way back, I'm a little disappointed. Say it ain't so, Bob.<br /><br />************************************************<br /><br /><b>THE ORIGINAL RAVE REVIEW</b><br /><br /><br />\u201cEverybody\u2019s wearing a disguise/To hide what they\u2019ve got left behind their eyes\u201d \u2013 okay, so what\u2019s Bob got left behind his eyes? A billion synapses connected to a million memories, that\u2019s what, and they burn with an intensity that only sharpens as he finally gets some of them down on paper. Quotable quotes leap from every page. On Guthrie: \u201cFor me it was like an epiphany, like some heavy anchor had just plunged into the waters of the harbour.\u201d On reading American history: \u201cI crammed my head full of as much of this stuff as I could stand and locked it away in my mind out of sight, left it alone. Figured I could send a truck back for it later.\u201d On the year 1962: \u201cThe whole city was dangling in front of my nose. I had a vivid idea of where everything was.\u201d<br /><br />At least half of this book is \u201cPortrait of the Artist as a Young Bohemian Folkie\u201d. \u201cWhat I was going to do as soon as I left home was just call myself Robert Allen\u2026\u201d but then there was a sax player called David Allyn, and that looked good. So he changed to Robert Allyn \u2013 \u201cmore exotic, more inscrutable\u201d. Then later \u201cI\u2019d seen some poems by Dylan Thomas. Dylan and Allyn sounded similar. Robert Dylan. Robert Allyn. I couldn\u2019t decide \u2013 the letter D came on stronger.\u201d He breathlessly captures the entrancement folk songs laid on his 19 year old self : \u201cFolk music was a reality of a more brilliant dimension\u2026 It was life magnified\u2026I scheduled my life around it\u201d. To us here in 2009, it looks like Bob became a folk star with very little effort, but he had to take a couple of lumps on the way. After memorising the whole Woody Guthrie songbook, a guy he describes as the Minneapolis Commissioner of the Folk Police escorts him to a phonograph player and plays him Ramblin\u2019 Jack Elliott, who'd already been doing pinpoint recreations of Woody for years. \u201cI felt like I\u2019d been cast into sudden hell\u2026 Elliott was far beyond me\u201d.<br /><br />After 100 pages on the Greenwich Village scene, we jump to 1966 and the tone darkens. Since 1963 he\u2019d been continually hyped and glorified \u2013 \u201cthe conscience of a generation\u201d and so on. It became intolerable. He tried to get out of the pressure cooker by moving to Woodstock but he found that \u201croadmaps to our homestead must have been posted in all fifty states for gangs of dropouts and druggies.\u201d Under seige on all sides, he used the minor motorcycle accident of 1966 to get some breathing space but the pressure never let up. Even his friends piled it on \u2013 in one jarring page Dylan tells of a car ride during which Robbie Robertson asks \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re gonna take it?\u201d Take what? \u201cYou know, the whole music scene.\u201d Dylan: \u201cIt was like dealing with a conspiracy. No place was far enough away. I don\u2019t know what everyone else was fantasizing about, but what I was fantasizing about was a nine-to-five existence, a house on a tree lined block with a white picket fence, pink roses in the back yard.

Sometimes the story of Bob Dylan is exactly like the Life of Brian:<br /><br />Bob: You don't need to follow me. You don't need to follow anybody! You've got to think for yourselves. You're all individuals!<br /><br />Bob\u2019s many followers, after a pause: Tell us how to think for ourselves, O Bob!<br /><br />There\u2019s nothing at all about going electric, nothing about Christianity, nothing about Rolling Thunder. Instead of those dramas, Bob regales us with ninety-pages on the making of one of his albums \u2013 song by song, session by session. Wow \u2013 which one? Could it be Freewheelin\u2019, or Blonde on Blonde? Blood on the Tracks perhaps? Nope, of course it\u2019s Oh Mercy. (Expect similar treatment of Knocked Out Loaded in Volume Two.) This section includes six pages on a truly crackbrained theory about all popular music being based on the number 2, but Lonnie Johnson one time showed him how you could base it on the number three. Hey, whoah there - three??\u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know why the number 3 is more metaphysically powerful than the number 2, but it is.\u201d He explains how this way of performing will revolutionise his art: \u201cMy playing was going to be an impellant in equanimity to my voice and I would use different algorithms that the ear is not accustomed to.\u201d Say what, Bob? Come again? But a few pages later we also get Bob\u2019s delight in buying a bumper sticker which said \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Grandpa\u201d. This is a man of many parts.<br /><br />Chronicles is stuffed full of Bob\u2019s Most Memorable Characters (Fred Neil, Dave Van Ronk, John Hammond, Ray Gooch) and Most Memorable Records (including a great section where Hammond gives him an advance copy of King of the Delta Blues Singers by Robert Johnson, and an account of How \u201cPirate Jenny\u201d Changed My Life). There\u2019s funny accounts of the folk purists versus the commercialisers. The whole book is drenched in music. You\u2019re tapping your foot as you read. Well, okay, but what about the private life? It\u2019s a little strange there. I was thinking he\u2019s just going to avoid the whole subject but no \u2013 right at the end, a sweet few pages on Suze Rotolo (the tone of which is considerably at variance with her public reminiscences) and a portrait of Joan Baez \u2013 \u201cshe seemed very mature, seductive, intense, magical. Nothing she did didn\u2019t work\u201d \u2013 before he got to meet her. Aww. But no, no Sara. Discretion and the usual cabal of lawyers would have made sure of that. And in the Oh Mercy section, many mentions of \u201cmy wife\u201d but never is she named. Pretty odd.<br />So. Don\u2019t look back? I should coco. When Bob looks back, it\u2019s warm, inclusive, annoying, incomprehensible, panoramic, diamond hard, inspirational, and it\u2019s book of the month, no contest.",

Funny how it emphasizes what no one really wants to know -- \"New Morning\" and \"Oh Mercy\" era stuff instead of everything from \"Hard Rain's Gonna Fall\" to \"Visions of Johanna\" to \"Shelter From the Storm\" to \"Isis.\" Those songs are hardly mentioned at all -- maybe one or two mentions of \"Hard Rain.\" Otherwise, this is a compulsively readable, folksy, lightly insightful, non-linear self-portrait of the mythic artist as regular guy from the North Country, a family man more concerned with privacy than popularity, a devout Woody Guthrie fanatic of course, not someone particularly special -- emphatically NOT the messiah, NOT the chosen one, NOT the voice of his generation, NOT the leader of the revolution -- umm except he acknowledges that, for a time, he could see and describe and supercharge the deep truth of reality. This ellipitically argues that his success came from casual, wide-open exposure to the world and art (more than just music). He's a super-sensitive empty vessel blessed with the necessary restless desire for MORE, sufficient native critical faculties, just enough OCD, and more than enough midwestern simplicity and charm -- that's pretty much it, says Dylan (not that he can be trusted).

I read the review thinking of him as Jokerman, and that movie made of him where others play him as characters throughout, and all the disguises he wore on stage, always, and always bullshitting us with lies at interviews, always spoofing. Wondered if the plagiarism might be the same, or sampling. But the research suggests something more deliberate and not just kiddingly deceptive. I need to think about that.

    "text": "I am not by any means a big fan of autobiographies or biographies written with the \u2018popular\u2019 market in mind: Autobiographies can all too often be divided into the self-aggrandising, self-serving, self-promotion type, or alternatively the celebrity/ghost written cut and paste, vacuous and pointless nonsense type or the pseudo \u2018warts and all expos\u00e9\u2019 type \u2013 or sometimes a combination of all three. Biographies on the other hand, more often than not are written with the agenda either of the fan or the character and career assassin. All of which for me seem ultimately pointless and futile. Whilst I am sure that there may be many fine books within this genre, maybe I just haven\u2019t come across them yet. (Perhaps I should look to the more accessible end of the literary / historical types of biography \u2013 although these can often be weighty and intimidated tomes). <br /><br />It goes without saying that the reading and success of any biography does of course depend on the audience, the reader. I am a big fan of Bob Dylan (his music up until around 1976) which does of course cloud and prejudice my view of anything written about or by him. I therefore approached this recommended autobiography with some caution but also with high hopes.<br /><br />Evident here, as you would expect, is Dylan\u2019s undeniable skill for storytelling and the story here is bookended by passages concerning the earlier part of his career. Unfortunately though, the book is somewhat dominated by a very lengthy middle passage devoted to the lead up to and writing, recording of Dylan\u2019s 1989 album \u2018Oh Mercy\u2019 with producer Daniel Lanois. Whilst this album did represent something of a renaissance for Dylan, it is certainly not viewed in the same light as such great and classic albums such as \u2018Blonde on Blonde\u2019, \u2018Highway 61 Revisited\u2019, \u2018Blood on the Tracks\u2019 (and more). Whilst there may be an element of \u2018Oh Mercy\u2019 representing a period when Dylan got his song-writing muse back, a return to form of sorts \u2013 it is hard to see how this is truly deserving of such a lengthy section of the book \u2013 so many words dedicated to this.<br /><br />Far more successful for me are the passages describing the New York, folk / art / cultural scene of the early 1960\u2019s and convey well what an inspirational and exciting time this must have been. The passages describing his discovery of Guthrie and others who influenced and inspired Dylan and who are clearly revered by him are also compellingly written. <br /><br />Interesting too (although nothing that we didn\u2019t really already know) are the descriptions of Dylan\u2019s first experiences as a proto-celebrity \u2013 along with his discomfort and frustration at being deemed the \u2018conscience and voice of a generation. I love the following quote from him in this book on that subject:<br /><br />\u201cI really was never any more than what I was \u2013 a folk musician who gazed into the grey mist with tear-blinded eyes and made up songs that floated in a luminous haze\u201d. <br /><br />Ultimately and unfortunately, this book seems to me very much a missed opportunity. I would like to have known more about the creation of, and inspiration behind those classic albums \u2013 rather than a late period partial return to form album such as \u2018Oh Mercy\u2019 \u2013 which pales by comparison. <br />Perhaps though, those great albums of the past have been deliberately left in the past with an all pervading and intact air of mystery and enigma. Maybe they\u2019ve just been written about and over analysed to death by others over the years? Maybe it would have been good to hear more from Dylan on these albums and maybe not \u2013 who knows? Maybe demystifying them would have detracted from their greatness \u2013 although I doubt it?<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Dylan does clearly acknowledge that musically he no longer holds the flame, no longer saw the 'truth' or 'had power and dominion over the spirits' or 'sees into things to see the truth of things' as they really are. A realistic acknowledgement that his greatest song-writing and recording days are well and truly over and long gone - recognising that now it is someone else's turn, that someone else will come along. <br /><br />Dylan seems in this book to be far more comfortable when writing about others \u2013 he is most compelling and engaging when writing of Woody Guthrie, Kurt Weill, Robert Johnson and others. Perhaps he is just not that comfortable when writing about himself and in some respects \u2013 he gives very little away \u2013 there is precious little about his part in the civil rights movement, nothing about his \u2018religious period\u2019, nothing really about his \u2018private life\u2019 so to speak of.<br /><br />As you would expect from Dylan, \u2018Chronicles\u2019 is not what you would expect \u2013 the uncompromising and obtuse even obscure attitude of Dylan throughout his musical career is something to be (more often than not) lauded \u2013 unfortunately here though \u2013 this results in what is ultimately for the most part a dissatisfying read. <br /><br /> <br />",

Apparently seeing this performed life indelibly changed Dylan's approach to songwriting. I bought myself G.W. Pabst's film version of TPO for this recent Christmas and I was absolutely riveted by Lotte Lenya's performance of the song, she's so cold , so decisive, much like Thomas Mann's Naphta. I was not a stranger to the song, having been moved for years by Nina Simone's rendition. My first encounter, however, happened years before when I was vacationing in Rome. Foot-sore, yet exhilarated, we had been walking all day and came across publicity posters for an Italian performer scheduled to play that evening the songs of Brecht/Weill in both German and Italian. For the life of me, I can't remember the name of the young woman -- but she owned the songs and all of us in attendance. One of the documentaries on the Three Penny Opera relates Brecht's penchant for appropriation, \"he stole, but with genius.\" I've heard many similar references to Picasso and it is simply coincidence that Dylan next speaks of Guernica and Pablo P after his rumination on Pirate Jenny.

When I first heard him sing, back in high school, he struck me as ludicrously nasal and harsh. Added to that, for an aspiring guitarist and budding student of music theory, Dylan\u2019s songs did not seem to have much substance\u2014just a few basic chords, strummed over and over. It pains me to say it, but I even passed up an opportunity to see him live during this time (my mom was going).<br />\t\t<br />Like many people, I suspect, I finally came around to Dylan through other people\u2019s versions of his songs. Specifically, I was obsessed with Jimi Hendrix\u2019s cover of \u201cAll Along the Watchtower,\u201d and I loved hearing Richie Havens sing \u201cJust Like a Woman.\u201d If I liked these songs so much, then Dylan really must have something going on.<br />\t\t<br />So I listened until something clicked, and suddenly I found myself loving the way he sang, and finding nothing insubstantial at all about his songs. Quite the contrary, I felt as though he had opened up another dimension of what a song could be and do. Indeed, there have been times when I have been completely floored by his music; and even now I feel as though there are certain emotional registers that only he can access. His best songs are so blazingly original that it is difficult even to compare them to other songs, so it seems fairly lame to say that he is one of the best American songwriters. Perhaps it does him better justice to say that Dylan is a real artist.<br />\t\t<br />This memoir is just what you would expect from Dylan. By that I mean that it exhibits some of the many contradictions in his character. One you might say is the way he melds highbrow and lowbrow together\u2014a folk singer reading symbolist poetry, a country boy discussing Balzac. It is telling that when he discusses two revelatory influences on his songwriting, one is a song by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, and the other is the recordings of Robert Johnson. That he can see and understand the value in both of these, and that he sees no contradiction in learning from both, is one of the secrets to Dylan\u2019s art. This tension is apparent even in the style of the memoir, which is folksy at the level of sentences, and yet sophisticated and nonlinear in organization.<br />\t\t<br />Another is the tension between revelation and standoffishness. Anyone setting down to write a memoir or to write a song wants to reveal herself, or at least a part of herself. And there are moments in Dylan when he can be almost touchingly sincere. But he is also wary of being defined, of being tied down; he wants always to escape categorization. Thus, he is willing to take us deeply into his songwriting and recording process in his album, <i>Oh Mercy</i> (of only moderate importance in his discography). But the miraculous years\u20141961 to 1966\u2014when he was at the top of his career, in terms of fame and creativity, are almost completely avoided. Knowing Dylan, I would have been surprised had he included them, but the omission cannot but be frustrating.<br /><br />In the end, I think this is a worthy memoir. The chapters on his early years in New York, trying to get his songwriting together, are especially valuable in taking you into his formative influences. Personally, I found his ambivalent relationship with his Minnesota family upbringing to be fascinating\u2014not bitter, or resentful, but nevertheless full of the urge to escape its influence. Do I understand Dylan? No way. But his songs help me to understand myself, and that is even better.",

His biggest influence was Woody Guthrie, and he had a great mentor in Dave Van Ronk who got him started at the Gaslight, a folk club. Dylan read widely and listened to the folk greats, especially the storytellers, in his quest to become a singer/songwriter. He spent his first months in New York sleeping on the couches of generous friends. It was an exciting day when he was signed by Columbia Records.<br /><br />Dylan also writes about a couple other points in his career, but they are not about his most popular albums. He tells about the frustrations involved in making \"New Morning\" in 1970, and recording \"Oh Mercy\" in 1989.<br /><br />In the 1970s, Dylan wanted privacy and time with his family. Some people considered him to be \"the voice of a generation\" and wouldn't leave him alone, running through his yard and tramping on his roof. He had to move several times to protect his wife and five children. He does not write about the origins of his famous \"protest songs\" that were used as anthems during the war in Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement.<br /><br />Dylan does a lot of name dropping of musicians, songs, authors, and historical events that influenced him, so the book might be more appreciated by readers who have lived through the Dylan era. One has to remember that Dylan is a great storyteller in his songwriting, and take some of his stories in the book with a grain of salt. \"Chronicles, Volume One\" is an entertaining memoir that shows Dylan at some important high and low points in his life.",

First off, ignore all those who are not even fans of Bob Dylan or are the ones that wish he would sing \"Like a Rolling Stone\" or \"Tangled up in Blue.\" Get over it. <br /><br />What I saw in this book was his inspiration. You will NEVER get this in any biography about any artist. Or at least rarely. Biographies and even autobiographies are a way for the \"experts\" to place the person in history. Dylan is more than willing to allow the music critics and even historians to do that (yes he acknowledges that he is a historical figure--and he is pretty humbled by it I assume). Just don't expect him to really care. They can pour through volumes of interviews (those that he gave that revealed something of the \"inner-Bob\") and articles and talk to hundreds of friends and relatives. They will still never KNOW the subject completely. Bob Dylan proved that with this book. <br /><br />The book is \"rambling\" for some, but I found this stream-of-consciousness style to be refreshing and definitely influenced by Jack Kerouac or Woody Guthrie--who he has been most compared. His story telling reminded my of a grandfather or the fascinating older man down the neighborhood who would entertain you with stories. Yes they \"rambled\" and digressed into other subjects. But they were REAL and true and revealed something about the speaker. <br /><br />I am sure when the book came out almost 4 years ago, people thought \"FINALLY he will give us a true picture of his life and influences!\" And then they were bitterly disappointed. Bob Dylan has always done things his owne way and refuses to be pigeon-holed into wherevever even his fans want him to be. That is what makes him THE artist for the last half of 20th Century and still into today! He wants true freedom--freedom from being who even millions of people demand him to be. A freedom we all should strive for. <br /><br />I look forward to reading Volume II and III or IV if ever writes them. <br /><br />And, finally, CONGRATS on the PULITZER PRIZE, BOB!

This is not an autobiography, and those wishing for a tell-all of the life of one of the most celebrated singer/songwriters in history won't find much to work with here.<br /><br />Dylan does ramble at length about the difficulties of fame, his stalkers, and his unwillingness to be a \"spokesperson\" for anything. That much feels very real and reveals a softer, family oriented Dylan we don't often see. There are other moments in his writing that fall apart quite spectacularly, especially as Dylan drones on endlessly about some new mathematical algorithm that freed him musically in the mid-80's, but which he mindlessly doesn't incorporate into his recollections of performances or in his recordings. He merely explains this new musical epiphany(rather abstractly and without clarity), stops himself short and then skips to some other unrelated period of his life. It's just one of many hiccups that occur throughout the text, revisiting why Dylan's previous works, <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/132025.Tarantula\" title=\"Tarantula by Bob Dylan\" rel=\"noopener\">Tarantula</a> most notably, was critically denounced decades ago.<br /><br />Chronicles Vol. 1 is book-ended by recollections of his early days in New York and his start with Columbia Records. In between is a focus on New Morning (a relatively unessential album) and a painfully long exposition on the frustrating process of recording Oh Mercy. Both these sections show just how difficult it is to write at length about the vagaries of the creative process, something even Dylan can't do with any real clarity.<br /><br />Scattered throughout are some interesting moments from Dylan's past, advice given to him along the way, and friends who lent couches to crash on. It is these small fragments which are the most entertaining, but you have to sift through a lot of nonsense to get to it. Fortunately, the language is not overwhelming and true Dylan aficionados will blaze through the 300 odd pages rather quickly, despite its rather erratic assembly. If you are someone obsessed by Dylan, then surely have a look at Chronicles Vol. 1, otherwise steer yourself to some of the better \"unauthorized\" biographies out there. ",

    "text": "I originally rated this two stars, but I had to take off a star after reading Paul Bryant's review detailing how much Dylan plagiarized. That was news to me, but not a surprise, considering Dylan padded his Nobel Lecture with lines from SparkNotes, of all places. It pains me that I have to add this book to my Nobel shelf. I understand that the prize was awarded primarily for his song lyrics, but the Nobel is awarded for an author's entire body of work, and so this sad, meandering, cliched, plagiarized excuse for a book has received the highest honor of world literature. <br /><br />I didn't completely hate this- I enjoyed reading about Dylan's encounters with famous artists, his opinions on their music, and his own approach to songwriting. I did not enjoy the writing. I appreciate many different styles and have a high tolerance for unusual approaches to literature, but nonstandard writing has to be purposeful, not just lazy. It seemed that Dylan couldn't be bothered to organize his thoughts, reached for cliches as the easiest way of expressing himself, and occasionally used unfamiliar words without stopping to check that they meant what he thought they did. Apparently he spent all of his energy plagiarizing phrases to make himself sound artsy and interesting. I understand that the folk tradition encourages borrowing, but to excuse plagiary in a novel on that ground is a total cop-out. He didn't use other books as inspiration, he stole from them, and that is unacceptable. ",

    "text": "This a rambling, and interesting book. It\u2019s not really linear and skips large chunks of time (the book starts in the early 60s, then jumps to 1967 then a big jump to about 1987 then back to 1959 with lots of side stories in amongst the main narrative). The best bits are the descriptions of people and places , and the early folk scene, and his influences particularly Woody Guthrie.",

    "text": "Bob Dylan has given us a meandering, often boring and only occasionally interesting account of some of the formative moments of his career. Two thirds of the book is taken up by the story of how he came to record \"New Morning\" and \"Oh Mercy.\" Yowzah! He gives only glancing, arrogant mention to the days of his most prolific and brilliant songwriting--which is fine, it doesn't shatter my perception of Dylan to find him arrogant and evasive, but I do take umbrage with the boring minutia of the recording-studio process of two of his more mid-level works. The two sections that deal with him moving to Minneapolis and then New York are, for the most part, pretty good, and his takes on Robert Johnson, Joan Baez, and, of course, Woody Guthrie--among many others--does help create a somewhat captivating picture of a certain, crystallized moment in American history as through the eyes of one of its great observers. <br /><br />And if you're a Dylan fan, it might be worth checking out for those sections alone, as its a quick read, but don't expect anything earth-shattering.<br /><br />UPDATE: Re-read in September 2008 for a class. Much better the second time around, maybe I just expected too much the first time, or maybe I've just changed my mind as to what Dylan is as an artist. That \"Oh Mercy\" section is still unbearable, though: his \"discovery of a new singing technique\" is total bullshit.",

    "text": "I had already given this 5 \u2b50\ufe0f on my first read years ago but somehow it felt even more magical this time around.<br /><br />Bob Dylan speaks to the side of me that I don\u2019t speak out loud but internalize a lot. His path is one all about seeking the truth in all things and I just dig that. He forms words in a way that is full of rhythm, layers, color and deep - a mirror of life. <br /><br />He\u2019s sold me on putting a visit to New Orleans at the top of my bucket list and I really enjoyed his musings on how he wrote his songs and how it evolved mathematically over time. I loved his honesty in the dry times when creativity is so far removed from you as an artist and exactly what that felt like. I understand that desert like feeling.<br /><br />I was fortunate to see him live 10 years ago at nine other than the Arizona State Fair. He played all his new bar music but that\u2019s what was honest for him at the time. <br /><br />For anyone wanting to learn more on him check out his 1965 San Francisco Press Conference as well as his documentary \u201cNo Direction Home\u201d - trust me it\u2019s worth your time.",

    "text": "Dylan writes as he sings: with honesty, passion and care for humanity. Misunderstood as an artist, labeled on countless ocassions as something he didn't recognize himself lof being, you can think that people just don't get your message so maybe you're singing to the wrong crowd. I was very pleased to see that Bob is also a pretty curious and well read man, a guy who values integrity, the idea of being humble, down to earth. Some of the best autobiography I've read, equally disturbing and heart-breaking, but in Dylan's words you can see hope and ambition, like there's always a path that keeps you going, a dream waiting for your arrival.<br />",

Criminals and refugees, traders and mystics... bullets used as currency... fear, and always uncertainty.<br />Artyom, our hero, is asked to deliver an important message that could affect the survival of humankind in the subways. On his way to the centre he is aided, and hindered, by a motley crew of individuals who reflect the chaos that reigns below. The voyage is full of menace (though moments of almost calm menace and surreality are not uncommon).<br />There is one brief sortie to the surface that becomes an adrenalyn-packed nightmare. I never realised that you can read a book through your fingers as you wait for the horrors to leap out from the ruins and the dark.<br />This is, of course, an Odyssey and our brave Ulysses has to strive through his labours as he comes face-to-face with the demons that litter his nightmare world distorted and turned inside out by humanity. His is a noble task and he is aided by heroic figures, heroes that could have stepped out of the ancient myths... Yet questions and doubts are raised constantly... what sort of humanity is it that Artyom wants to save?... and what nightmares come flowing down the dark tunnels of the Metro.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this book. Everything about it promised so much! The setting is the Moscow metro system in the year 2033. Above ground, it appears that humanity has been wiped out by nuclear war. The survivors live entirely in the underground tunnel system; stations have evolved into microcosms of the old social and political systems of Russia. The inhabitants are now into the second generation, and Glukhovsky touches on some of the adaptive changes humans have undergone as a result of living in a lightless world, believing themselves the last representatives of humanity. Strange mutations have resulted from the nuclear devastation, and frightening creatures are taking over the world above; some of them threaten life in the tunnel systems. The premise is simply fascinating, and begs for more attention by the author. But one of the main flaws of the book as I see it is that Glukhovsky simply does not pay enough attention to building a cohesive, believable world, and the promise in the premise is not fulfilled. Glukhovsky's primary concern is with relating the adventures of his 'hero' Artyom, a young man drawn ostensibly by chance into a strange quest to save the metro system. The structure of the quest is aimless and ultimately lacks satisfcatory closure. I struggled to remain engaged with Artyom and indeed the fate of the metro system. About a quarter of the way through I simply stopped caring about what would happen to any of them. <br />The novel rushes to a close in the last ten pages (after a build up of nearly 450 pages) and these last few pages throw the whole book into a new light - suddenly, I saw how the novel could have been a rich critique of modern humanity, an exploration of the madness and futility of war, and the destructiveness of anthropocentrism. I am so disappointed it failed!<br /><br />A factor that served only to exacerbate any issues I had with plot and character development was exacerbated by what is almost certainly a poor translation (I am giving Glukhovsky himself the benefit of the doubt, as I cannot read Russian and verify the quality of the original) , and some awful copy-editing. <br /><br />The [only:] good news is that this novel has been adapted into a PC game \u2013 and I think the story material is eminently suited to it! I actually bought the game, and I am looking forward to exploring it.<br />",

It is set in the Moscow Metro, where the last survivors hide after a global nuclear holocaust. It was published in 2005 in Russia and on March 28, 2010 in the United States. <br /><br />In 2013, a nuclear war occurred, forcing a large amount of Moscow's surviving population to relocate to underground metro stations in search of refuge. <br /><br />Eventually, the communities settled in the underground train stations developed into independent states. Soon, factions emerged, ranging from the independent peacekeepers the \"Rangers of the Order\", to the communist \"Red Line\" faction and the fascist \"Fourth Reich\", to the more powerful factions such as \"Polis\", which contained the greatest military power and the most knowledge of the past, and the \"Hanza\" regime, which controlled the main ring of metro stations by its sheer economic power. <br /><br />As these groups began to evolve, the Red Line and the Fourth Reich quickly entered a state of war, as both sought to destroy the other. As the war raged, the stations who refused to join either side were either demolished by the factions, merged into the Hanza regime, raided by criminal bandits, or formed their own independent states. <br /><br />Other stations were outright destroyed by animals, mutated by the nuclear fallout. While most of the stations were controlled by the 3 main factions, some stations formed an independent alliances, including the station VDNKh (\"Exhibition\"). <br /><br />Within that station, the events of Metro 2033 unfold. The protagonist of the novel is a 20-year-old man named Artyom who was born before the nuclear holocaust. <br /><br />He was saved from a horde of carnivorous rats that killed his mother and the inhabitants of his station as a baby by Sukhoi, a military officer. Sukhoi is now one of the authorities of VDNKh, one of the stations in the Russian metro, and has raised Artyom as his son. <br /><br />Artyom spends his time on patrol in the tunnels and working in the mushroom factories. Artyom meets a man named Hunter, who is looking for Sukhoi. <br /><br />The three meet and discuss the situation in VDNKh. VDNKh is facing increasing attacks from mysterious creatures known as The Dark Ones, who inspire terror throughout the station. Hunter leaves, but asks to speak to Artyom. <br /><br />Artyom confesses that 10 years earlier, he and his friend went to the surface at the neighbouring station, Botanical Gardens. They were unable to seal the exit after their visit and the Dark Ones have been using this entrance to the metro ever since. <br /><br />Hunter tells Artyom that he intends to gather intel on the Dark Ones, and in the event that he doesn't return Artyom must carry a message to a man named Melnik at Polis with news of the threat. Feeling a sense of responsibility for the Dark Ones' attacks and seeking adventure, Artyom accepts. ...<br /><br />\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646

The structure is repetitive, there is no overall development of main character's psyche, except at the very end, too late, I'm afraid. Events are arbitrary, there are too many unnecessary descriptions of metro stations and reader looses himself in all the mentioned tunnels. Women play no important role, there is none, except for some hysterical mother here and there. Apparently in the future they can't carry weapons, fight, protect or be a community leader.

    "text": "The premise of Metro 2033 is excellent, and the ultimate conclusion of the story (the last 10 pages), though treading on an overused SF trope, could have added an excellent undercurrent to the plot. Yet, in-between the opening and the ending, there is over 400 pages of, well, nothing. After introducing the setting, the main character, Artyom, is sent on a quest by someone he just met, for reasons which are not elaborated upon, to the ultimate purpose of doing...something. That's a great way to start a journey, isn't it?<br /><br />For the rest of the book, Artyom simply wanders around the metro system tunnels and stations, trying to get to his goal. Every now and then, he goes on rambling, nearly incoherent philosophical rants about the nature of humanity--presented with incredibly juvenile thinking, as though it were written by a moody high-schooler. He meets people, then they leave after a few pages. And there doesn't seem to be any overall plot that ties it together, other than his loosely defined \"quest.\" To quote the book, <i>\"it just went on and on.\"</i><br /><br />This, as a finished novel, reads like a rough draft. He rambles on for ages about Artyom's travels through the metro, yet the motivation for his doing so seems sketchy, at best, until the last 10 pages. Characters are barely developed, and are then tossed aside, as soon as they have any personality. Locations have only minimal descriptions, likely assuming that you're already familiar with what the Russian subway system looks like--I shouldn't have to look things up on Google Images to understand what an author is talking about. None of it manages to come together and form a cohesive world. It's a large jumble of fragmented good ideas; and it seems the author had to include <i>every single one</i> of his good ideas, without thinking about whether or not they were appropriate or useful to the narrative. I also have a tough time buying into the idea of everything on the surface mutating into super monsters within a single generation after nuclear war. This may be fantasy, but <i>COME ON!</i> At least give us a believable timeline.<br /><br />I could have probably given this 2-stars, expect for the fact that all of the good ideas the book presents are utterly wasted. I've mentioned a few times how it quickly wraps up in about 10 pages, and that's the problem: the ideas in those 10 pages should have been everywhere else in the novel. You can't have a compelling conclusion when there is no build up to it. Simply stating, \"This is what it was all about,\" is the worst kind of lazy writing. I was appalled at how wasteful this book was of its ideas, characters, setting and, most importantly, my time.<br /><br />All this is without even mentioning the massive amount of typos, grammatical errors, wrong names, and general sloppiness of the English translation. Perhaps I should have played the video game version, instead. At least then I would have been able to kill things, which is what I wanted to do upon finishing this novel.",

    "text": "Welcome to the post apocalyptic world of <b>Metro 2033</b>. It\u2019s a grim and depressing existence, this. This novel conveys a claustrophobic atmosphere rarely felt. Everything in this underworld has a dreamy (nightmarish) quality about it. Consider: perpetual darkness except for signal fires and faint red emergency lighting at some stations. And if you\u2019re travelling, don\u2019t forget your pocket flashlight.<br /><br />So what\u2019s the story? Well, the apocalypse has come and gone. Somebody pushed the button, and only the few who made it to the underground metro survived. They\u2019re still there, decades later, unable to come out (except for Stalkers, who wear gas masks and protective gear). Pockets of civilisation have formed at different stations, each with their own politics, religions and mythologies.<br />But there are things in the darkness, and there are things in the outside world that want in\u2026<br /><br /><i>Metro 2033</i> is a good idea, and a fine example of Sci-Fi Horror. When it succeeds, it succeeds well. Unfortunately the reverse is also true: when it stumbles...<br /><br /><u>Cons</u><br /><br />There is often a lot of dialogue that doesn\u2019t seem relevant to the story. The plot skips around so much and takes off on random tangents so often that the whole thing at times feels like an exercise in frustration. There is a <b>lot</b> of political and philosophical meandering, and although it\u2019s sometimes interesting and relevant, many times it\u2019s not. Characters sometimes behave totally inexplicably. There are so many stations and factions that I found it difficult to separate them in my mind (the map didn\u2019t really help) and eventually everything blurred together (it\u2019s all just one dark tunnel with a station attached). The awkward sentence structuring and clumsy writing doesn\u2019t help. This seems to be at least partly attributable to translation issues (but perhaps not limited to). <br /><br /><u>Pros</u><br /><br />Now the good news. The story is filled with legends, half-truths and mythology, which will keep you on your toes. The mythical qualities reminded me of the <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/43615.The_Gunslinger__The_Dark_Tower___1_\" title=\"The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower, #1) by Stephen King\" rel=\"noopener\">The Gunslinger</a>. <i>Metro 2033</i> also has its fair share of <b>genuinely</b> spooky moments. It\u2019s <b>very</b> atmospheric. And yes, it is actually pretty cool at times.<br />Now, the list of cons may seem longer than the list of pros, but that\u2019s only because I made a list of things that annoyed me as they popped up. You should at least give this a try. It\u2019s a novel experience (no pun intended).<br /><br /><i>\u2018I\u2019ve died,\u2019 [he] said. \u2018There is no more me.\u2019<br />And as straight as a cross-tie, he fell face down.</i> <br />",

    "text": "This is a cult-classic dystopia that managed to catapult high despite originally being given away for free a little more than a decade ago. It's a testament of word-of-mouth.<br /><br />I found myself curious even before having this recommended to me, but I'm only now getting around to reading it. For shame, right? <br /><br />This is very much a Russian tale with everything that implies. Post-nuclear survival tale within the metro tunnels, humanity becoming Morlocks and strange flying creatures preventing any egress. (Along with the heavy radiation, but who's really counting that?) ;)<br /><br />The novel was very interesting in how the novel was nearly a traditional coming-of-age tale, but more than that, I nearly had to stop at a regular basis because of how episodic it seemed, too. Maybe I should have. I might have enjoyed it more.<br /><br />As it was, we followed the main character from one part of the metro tunnel to another, discovering strange belief systems that happen to be pretty much everything that we moderns know now. Christians, fascists, satanists, worm-worshiping cannibals and of course capitalists were discovered with fresh, unpolluted eyes. The novel had a lot to say. It was very ideal-and-idealism oriented. Maybe it was just the utter feel of being disillusioned by all the lies that we humans keep telling ourselves, and maybe it was that old Russian pragmatism at work, but I thought this was both the novel's main strength and main weakness.<br /><br />Maybe I wasn't in the mood for it. And maybe I've already had my fill of such classic translated Russian novels. :) Either way, I appreciated this novel while not entirely getting into it.<br /><br />That's not to say it wasn't full of great parts. It refers to and pays homage to <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/331256.Roadside_Picnic\" title=\"Roadside Picnic by Arkady Strugatsky\" rel=\"noopener\">Roadside Picnic</a>, Stalkers and all. The ending made up for almost all the slow parts that felt like kind-of a slog. <br /><br />All told, I'd recommend this for fans of extremely well-developed post-apocalypse literature with a huge serving of what classic Russian literature is known for: shovels and ideas. :)",

    "text": "After reading Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro 2033, I felt compelled to offer a review. Frankly it is the best post-apocalyptic sci-fi I have ever read. While some things may get lost in translation, and it has a lot of typos, for me it did not detract from Artyom's epic struggle to reach Polis from the subway station of VDNKh and deliver the message that the dark ones are invading the station and the future of the entire metro population is at risk.<br /><br />Set in the year 2033, it depicts mankind's struggle to survive in a Moscow subway system after nuclear bombs have destroyed the surface and contaminated the air, resulting in the birth of a multitude of mutant monsters, creating a life of constant fear and terror for the metro human pupulation. There is a new species, more adapted to the radiation filled atmosphere, intent on replacing mankind.<br /><br />The story operates on a number of different levels, is tightly plotted, very descriptive and real. Lead protagonist Artyom is very believable as he analyzes the politics at work during his journey to try and save the future of mankind.<br /><br />Glukhovsky criticizes Communism, institutionalized religion, cult worship, man's inabilty to get along with his neighbours, the futility of capitalism and the hopelessness of war (I'm sure I'm missing a few). Inside the small states organized at different metro stations, the different control groups become a microcosm of our society, almost an allegory of how, as George Orwell put it, \"absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"<br /><br />The ending is a twist and a shocker that left me feeling empty and hollow for a few days afterwards.<br /><br />This is a well-written, poignant and riveting work destined to become a timeless piece of literature that will be studied, admired and critiqued for many years to come.<br /><br />",

    "text": "I love a good dystopia, and <i>Metro 2033</i> delivers a particularly interesting example of the type. Glukhovsky's vision of the remnants of human society huddling in the damp and eerie darkness of the Moscow metro while surviving on rats and carefully cultivated mushrooms is a fascinating scenario (Although I kept wondering how we would fare here in Melbourne where our subway consists of only four stations- we don't have much space for a post-apocalyptic microcosm of society down there!).<br /><br />After the surface has been rendered uninhabitable the last of humanity has taken shelter in Moscow's vast metro system. Typically, humanity has split into rival clans and political groups and an uneasy tension reigns between them as the balance of resources teeters towards the extinction of our race. While the rival groups compete strange things are happening in the darkest, most distant tunnels. Odd creatures have been seen. People are disappearing. Amongst the fear and growing chaos a young man, Artyom, begins a journey to the center of the metro network, to warn the people there of the dangers that are coming.<br /><br />I love this setup. it's grim, moody, and at times quite scary. Yet while there's a lot going for the story in <i>Metro 2033</i> it feels a tad episodic- the hero bounces from group to group in the new underground society in a way that feels more like a guided tour for the reader (See the crazy socialists! Visit the fearsome fascists! Marvel at the mad religious cults!) than a plausible journey. The end also comes up very rapidly, almost as though the author was rushing to draw the narrative to a big finish. As a result, the finale feels a little undercooked. I also got the feeling sometimes that the text may have lost some of its grace in translation, leading to some clunky bits that I'm sure flowed better in the original Russian.<br /><br />Overall though this book is an enjoyable read, and the long, dark tunnels of the Moscow metro have stayed with me. Whenever my train passes through the Melbourne Metro I now find myself casting around for a patch of ground that would make a good mushroom farm.",

While reading along, I even have often contemplated to abandon the book. On the one hand, I very much admired the setting of the novel which was quite innovative, as the story is played out in a very special environment, i.e. the Moscow metro system, where the last humans are surviving in little settlements on the metro platforms after a devastasting disaster occured that supposedly destroyed the world above. On the other hand, however, if you assume that this special setting would have guaranteed a very exciting story, you will get disappointed. The book is written in a boring and non-committed language which often induced me to skip half pages. There is a lot of rambling about nothing important, even when the dark tunnels and metro stations with each their own sort of atmosphere and people could have provided very interesting tales. <br /><br />Artyom, the protagonist, is sent on a mission of which he does not actually have a clue what it entailed, but it must have to do with the deformed creatures from the world above that are trying to enter the metro system. Strangely enough, the exact purpose of his mission is never revealed. So we as readers have no idea either. Even after some 400 pages, it irked me that you still had no idea what sort of person Artyom is, how he looked or developed as a result of his adventures and that also applies to his occasional fellow travellers. I found Artyom a boring character so, consequently, you are not really interested in what happens to him. I did not understand what the last pages were meant to be about and I see that more readers had the same trouble. A pity, because the story had such potential.

Each leg of Artyom's journey develops and defines him from a boy to a man, who is destined to become the mediator between the human world in the metro and what resides above on earth.

In 2013, there was a massive nuclear war. I read the entire book, and am still not 100% sure why or what exactly happened, but never mind that. So the world has gone to hell in a handcart. Everything was blasted with nuclear weapons and biological weapons. This caused evil radiation to spread all over and kill the people and everything else. We are in Moscow, Russia. The people there were pretty clever and ran for the underground Metro Stations to get away from all the crap happening on the surface. And this is where we are, twenty years later, 2033, in the Moscow Underground. <br /><br />Artyom, a twenty year old young man, is our protagonist and we follow him via 3rd person throughout the novel. I am slightly confused here because Artyom has some memories of living on the surface with his mother, but he is 20, meaning the nuclear war destroyed Moscow when he was born. I suppose it made it more interesting to have him remember some vague memories than stick to simple number counting. When Artyom and his Mother did move into the Metro, they chose a bad station to stay at. Because when he was 7, a mob of carnivorous rats invaded the station killing everyone! Accept for Artyom and a few military soldiers. Artyom was rescued by one of these soldiers, Sukhoi, who took him as his adopted son. They now live in VDNKH, which is the northern most inhabited metro station of the Moscow underground. The story begins with our 20 year old Artyom who is doing watch duty in the northern tunnel. All stations have watch guards, because there are apparently mutants in the tunnels or sometimes monsters from the surface get in. He is talking to his partners about this new threat that the station is facing, The Dark Ones. They are humanoid, but all black. These Dark Ones are believed to come from the surface and VDNKH has had to fight them off. These bad ass creatures just approach the station carrying no weapons; they just march forward until they are blasted apart by gunfire. Oh and they give off a feeling of horror...aaaah scary! Not really, especially because you never experience Artyom fighting them, it is simply a watered down memory that he reflects on. Artyom does a ton of this, reflecting that is. Often we could have experienced something really cool with him, but instead the event happens, then we just have Artyom thinking back on it. This was frustrating!<br /><br /> A man named Hunter comes to VDNKH; he is seemingly a friend of Artyom\u2019s adoptive Father. He has come to investigate this threat of the Dark Ones. Hunter sees that Artyom is a bit of a lost soul and takes advantage of that. He tells Artyom that he is going to go to the Botanical Garden\u2019s where he thinks the Dark Ones have their base. If he does not return soon, then Artyom is to take a message to a friend in Polis and warn him of the threat. Polis is a long, long way away. From what I could understand it was about in the middle of the Metro and it is like the Utopia of the Metro. So off Hunter goes, doesn\u2019t return, so off Artyom goes on his journey to Polis. He tells no one and simply disappears. I was like, oh, okay not a bad beginning I can get behind this. Go Artyom, you go fight those monsters in the tunnels and get to Polis before it is all too late! <br /><br />But then I was put through torture, pure agonising torture! Artyom goes from station to station on his journey to Polis. His trips through the dark tunnels were normally quick with no monsters!!! No bloody monsters! Yes, there was psychological fear and some unexplained deaths and stuff, but I repeat no monsters! My husband is having a ton of fun fighting mutants in the video game version of the book, and me? Well, I get bogged down at each station where Artyom meets people who always help him a bit on his journey. Each station has developed into its own little nation with its own ideology and way of living. Some stations are Communist, some have free rule, some are Fascist bastards who have developed a fourth Reich and hunt down Caucasians, some have cast systems, some are religious sects, etc. Some stations are wealthy, like the Hansae controlled federation stations. But, some are really poor and are more like stations for beggars and dodgy trade. The station names also confused me, they all sounded the same. But, this isn\u2019t the book\u2019s fault. I am sure that if you are Russian or if you have visited Moscow, then it must be really interesting to see what happens to the metro stations you know.<br /><br /> Artyom meets a bunch of people who are all on their own agenda, from a man who believes he is the reincarnation of Genghis Khan, to a Jehovah\u2019s Witness who tries to convert him, to a Braman who believes in written knowledge only. It gets extremely tiring after a while, just sitting at these stations listening to various theories on what controls the Metro and people and things in general. Where was the action I was promised! I did get a bit of it... all of two chapters, when Artyom went to the surface. The surface is a mess with real monsters, but then he just goes back into the metro and it is the same old same old again. This book is more of Artyom\u2019s search to discover what he believes in a spiritual manner, rather than his mission to save the Metro from the Dark ones.<br /><br />For my full review which includes quite a bit of additional info please click:<br /><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bookrantorrave.com/blog/metro-2033-rant\">http://www.bookrantorrave.com/blog/me...</a><br /> ",

    "text": "Have you read the synopsis? What an unique and compelling premise, right? However its executions did not work for me at all. Let's look at all the things that ruined the book for me.<br /><br /><b>WRITING STYLE</b><br />There was too much telling-not-showing. I read english version (originally written in russian) so it may have been caused by inproper stylistic translation, who knows. Either way, it lead to story lacking true emotions.<br /><br /><b>ROAD TRIP FEEL</b><br />Metro 2033 had a road trip feel to it. Hero goes from station to station, meeting various people and talking with them about everything and nothing. Those side characters are never present for too long. Road-tripy feel simply does not work for dystopian novel. It was boring with minimum action and what good is dystopian novel if it does not keep you on the edge of your seat?<br /><br /><b>PROPAGANDA</b><br />The story was too \"in your face\" philosophical, touching all subjects from politics to religion and meaning of life. It felt as if author wanted to present his views on given matters in forcefull way using long monologues and left no space for discussion. It took bigger part of the book and it was seriously annoying.<br /><br />Metro 2033 is a story with plenty of potential that was not met. So sadly, I won't continue reading this trilogy.",

    "text": "This is one of the best post-apocalyptic novels I've ever read. It's got a fair amount of action, but it is by no means dominated by it. There is plenty of Eastern European introspection and philosophy here to balance out the monsters and fire-fights. Lots of suspense too. The story is top-notch and Artyom is a very identifiable protagonist who develops quite a bit throughout the story.<br /><br />I had to knock off a star for some really really sloppy editing. It seemed like every few pages there was a repeated word, missing punctuation, etc. I'm not sure why so many blatant errors would appear in a book published by Gollancz. It throws you off and sort of kills the mood, but...the book was so compelling it didn't bother me that much.",

    "text": "I won't lie, this book hovered at around 3 stars until halfway through, then to 3.5 stars three quarters of the way through. The ending though...the ending completely hammered me in the gut and this into 5 star range. <br /><br />The beginning is a bit slow, the dialogue is some thick writing most of the time, it's not light or airy. It's substantial and dare I say real. The way people would actually talk. <br /><br />About halfway through the book it dawned on me what I, at least, realized it was. For me it is a futuristic dystopian horror Pilgrim's Progress. Not so much on the Christian overtones but still with substantial moralistic punch. I personally loved Pilgrim's Progress growing up and suddenly seeing this book in that light helped me see and grasp it more easily. <br /><br />The creatures, the world, the Metro, the people, are very well thought out and built. By the end you truly feel like you were there through the whole thing, walking just off of Artyom's right, struggling when he struggled, elating in his victories, confused when he was confused, hopeless and helpful as he was. And I think this is 100% what author was going for, it's why it's a slog at times, it's confusing at times, it's exciting, and a breeze at times. We are Artyom and he is we. <br /><br />The ending hit me out of no where, completely unexpected on my part. Just. What a twist. I am very excited to read the following books. At this point I have purchased all 3 of the video games and plan to finish the first video game now that I have finished the first book. Then read the 2nd book and then the 2nd video game and so on. <br /><br />This is not a book for a break, this is not a book for an escape. This is a book for those wanting a journey, not a ride, a step by step walk into the depths of all that is humanity, the good, the bad, the blessed, and the diseased. <br /><br />Until we meet again Artyom.",

    "text": "<i>\n  <b>People, you say? No, my friend, they are beasts. They are a pack of jackals. They were preparing to tear us apart. And they would have. But they forgot one thing. They are jackals but I am a wolf.</b>\n</i><br /><br />Most people who come to <i>Metro 2033</i> probably do so after playing the excellent video game adaptation (you can see the trailer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc2hhef-Nzo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a>). The game is an immersive first person shooter with great atmosphere, and has received very favorable reviews. I completed it once, and would like to do so again one day. The game's success brought much interest in the source material - Dmitry Glukhovsky's eponymous novel. Glukhovsky started writing the book when he was just 18 years old, and first published it on the internet for free in 2002 (complete Russian text is still available on his personal website). Although a print version was eventually published in Russia in 2005, the novel was translated into foreign languages only in 2010, to coincide with the game's release date. It has since spawned a sequel and started a book franchise, allowing other writers to experiment in its universe.<br /><br />It's an interesting spin on an old premise. The novel is set in Moscow, and the year is 2033 - two decades after a nuclear war, when civilization like we know it has literally disappeared from the face of the planet. To escape radiation and nuclear winter most of the surviving population was forced to flee underground and settle in the city's vast metro system, which became the world's largest nuclear bunker. Soon, a new order was established within the metro - with each station becoming an independent state, with its own security and border controls. Stations formed alliances and confederations with one another, and broke them through war. People organized themselves into fractions, with two biggest ones - the communist Red Line and the fascist Fourth Reich - engaging in a full and permanent war with one another over the metro and its resources. Not all stations are inhabited - some have been abandoned because of floods and fires, or cut off from other stations because connecting tunnels have collapsed. Some stations have been lost to the Dark Ones - mythical, paranormal creatures who are said to have come from the ravaged surface. <br /><br />People of the metro have never seen natural light - even Stalkers, who venture to the surface to explore the ruined city for supplies, do so only at night. Although some stations breed pigs and other animals, people mostly eat mushrooms as they do not require natural light to flourish. Stations are on constant alert, as they come under constant attack from either of the two major fractions, ordinary bandits or mutated creatures - and on one of such stations, VDNKh, lives our protagonist, Artyom. Artyom is 21, and was born before the nuclear holocaust destroyed the planet - but has spent his entire life at the VDNKh, where he eventually joined the security guard. One day at the closing of his shift the border outpost is approached by a strange man named Hunter, who is bent on fighting and destroying the Dark Ones; he makes Artyom promise that if he does not return, he'll travel to Polis, a far-away station, and seek its assistance in his name. Can you guess what happens?<br /><br />Where Glukhovsky really succeeds is the building of the metro's lore - the atmosphere of the decaying, ruined network of tunnels and railways, where people live in constant half-shadows and where a tent is the most one can hope for privacy. The fact that the population is not only literally cut off from the world, but often also from other human settlements created significant social degradation through delearning: people forgot their past and gave in to primitive beliefs and superstition, and formed totalitarian and oppressive regimes in a situation when human unity is most necessary. On his journey to Polis Artyom will encounter many characters, each of which will give him a tour of a different philosophy - from simple and ordinary thugs, through revolutionary communists and cruel fascists, to spiritual mystics and religious extremists. Every encounter will have an influence on Artyom, and shape his character throughout his journey.<br /><br />Unlike the game, however, <i>Metro 2033</i> is a lot less action oriented and linear. The novel focuses much more on Artyom's internal existential dilemma whereas the game focuses mostly on simple survival in hostile conditions; there are plenty of action sequences but they are a background to the narrative, and not the focus. Glukhovsky was inspired by the Strugatsky brothers, Stanis\u0142aw Lem and Ray Bradbury among others, and his ideas are many - along with histories, myths, legends and secrets, philosophy and social commentary. This is a very sprawling and expansive book which covers a lot of ground, but might leave the reader desiring that it had done so on a bit clearer path. But this would be against its nature, which is like the metro - branching out in many directions, and to see all that it has to offer you have to take every line.<br /><br />The novel is offered in translation, which might sometimes make the prose sound stilted and unnatural to readers unaccustomed to the natural rhythm and melody of the Russian language. Still, it's a ride worth taking and I believe it will satisfy most readers looking for interesting - and mature! - dystopian fiction. Very dark and atmospheric book, and a good game to boot - I can't wait to read the sequel.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i>It's now or never!</i>\n</b><br /><br /><br /><br />",

    "text": "Suzanne Collins has <s>balls</s> <b>ovaries of steel</b> to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. <br>Two reasons why this book rocks: <b>(a)</b> It is not <i>Twilight</i>, and <b>(b)</b> I really hate reality shows. <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682395988i/34178549.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><b>\n  <i>Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from \"Survivor\" to \"Hunger Games\"? </i>\n</b><br><br>Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. <b>But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency.</b> And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: <blockquote>\n  <i>\u201cBut just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.\u201d </i>\n</blockquote> <b>So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter?</b> Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. <b>She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower.</b> She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I <b>love</b> this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl. <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682395988i/34178550.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><br>And I love this book because - despite <i>The Hunger Games</i> being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* <b>but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. </b>(*)<blockquote>\n  <i> * Unlike other so-called \"books\", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)<br><br>** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying \"Team Peeta\" and \"Team Gale\". (***)<br><br>*** Because <b>clearly</b> nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. <b>*eyeroll*</b> </i>\n  <br>\n</blockquote> <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682395988i/34178551.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. <b>There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction. </b> <br><br>Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. <b>At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love.</b> But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being \"Lover Boy\", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah...<br><br>...Rue...Oh, Rue...<img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682395988i/34178552.jpg\" width=\"320\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><br>Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start.<b> Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless.</b> Whose <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"4e4dedfe-e3a0-44e7-923d-e8331ea7c93d\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"4e4dedfe-e3a0-44e7-923d-e8331ea7c93d\">death scene</label> brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. <br><br>Suzanne Collins strictly follows the <b>\"show, don't tell\" </b>rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.<br>----------<br>I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets <b>3.75 stars</b>. <blockquote>\n  <i>\"Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat.\" </i>\n</blockquote>-----------------------------------------<br><b>\n  <u>EDITED TO ADD:</u>\n</b> <br>So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682395988i/34178553.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p><b><i>I CRIED TWICE </i></b>(yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). <br>First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him <b>WITHOUT ANY HESITATION</b>. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* <br>The second time I teared up - <b>Rue. Oh Rue...</b> And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... <br><br><b><i>PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN.</i></b> *SOB*</p></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]>",

And while Katniss has sworn to come back to her sister, she really has to wonder, what will be left of her if she returns.<blockquote>\n  <i>\u201cHere's some advice. Stay alive.\u201d </i>\n</blockquote>Honestly, this was the <b>best apocalyptic YA teen novel I've read this year.</b><br><br>To be fair, this was one of the <b>very first YA series</b> I read, so every time I re-read it, I am just overwhelmed with nostalgia.<br><br>But, when I take off my rose-tinted glasses, I still think it's a <b>pretty solid series.</b><br><br><b>The characters are really well-done. </b> <br><br>I love how Katniss's motivation is both <b>pure and ruthlessness </b>- and her personality isn't tainted with over-the-top self-sacrificing eyerollingly awful simpering mess that I see in quite a few of the newer YA series. <br><br>Katniss's love for her sister humanized her otherwise stiff character. Her pride and will to survive<b> energized the novel</b> and kept me absolutely hooked. <br><br>I appreciate that the <b>smidge of romance </b> does not overpower the novel. Finally, a YA novel that plot doesn't solely hang on a love triangle - I love that it's more of a survivalist story. <br><br>Overall, really pleased with this novel - cannot wait to reread the rest!<br><br><b>Audiobook Comments</b><br>Read by Carolyn McCormick and she gave life to Katniss!

    "text": "I was forced into watching Mockingjay: Part II this weekend. To clarify, I watched the second part of the last <i>Hunger Games</i> movie <b>without having read any of the books, without having watched any of the movies.</b><br /><br />Needless to say, I was <i>confused as fuck</i>.<br /><br />So many questions and thoughts ran through my mind as I watched the movie. Why is Peeta so thin? Did that huge-ass bruise really disappear from her neck the next day? Is Katniss <i>supposed</i> to look like she's about to burst into tears at any given moment, or is that just Jennifer Lawrence? Woody Harrelson is in this movie? Hey, it's Margaery from Game of Thrones! Who's President Snow? What's a Mockingjay? Lesser Hemsworth is pretty hot.<br /><br />Well, you get the point. I know how the book ended and I still have no idea who anyone is, and neither do I know their names, with the exception of Peeta, Gale, President Snow, that Coin woman, and Katniss. Of course, knowing how the book ended means I probably should read the first book, so <b>here I am, the last person on earth to read The Hunger Games.</b><br /><br />And it was good. It was really good. My sister was right (she usually is).<br /><br />What else can I say that hasn't already been said? I loved it. The world building was interesting (although it helps that I've seen what it looks like on the big screen), and Katniss is <i>awesome</i>. One of the things my sister didn't like about the first movie is that the on-screen Katniss was different from her portrayal in the first book. I haven't watched that movie, but I kind of see how the screen portrayal of Katniss might have bothered her. Book-Katniss is strong, kick-ass without being a Mary Sue. She has a fierce love for her sister, and she is manipulative and cunning. She uses the prospect of romance to protect herself, she has no qualms about using people, and I love that about her.<br /><br />Time to watch Movie #1!",

But basically the TL;DR of this review is that <i>The Hunger Games</i> truly holds up so well in 2020, and this reread was such a treat. I felt such nostalgia, happiness, and hope between these pages, and I already can\u2019t wait to revisit this story again. Also, again, this review will have <b>spoilers</b>, so use caution if you don\u2019t want me to tell you what happens in each chapter of this book!<br><br><i>\n  <b>\u201cHow could I leave Prim, who is the only person in the world I'm certain I love?\u201d</b>\n</i><br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter One: </b><br>This first chapter really starts off with a heartbreaking bang. We quickly learn so many characters, but we even more quickly learn what type of character Katniss Everdeen is. The basic premise of this tale is that there are twelve districts and once a year each district will select two young candidates to fight to the death in a game, which will also be broadcasted for the world to see. Every year, a teenagers name gets added once to this random selection pool, but each year they get older another time their name gets added. Also, you can add your name more times to get food and supplies for your family, and this is very much the norm for most children. Katniss\u2019s sister, Prim, only has her name in the drawing once because it is her first time, where Katniss has her name added over twenty times. Yet, you see where this is going\u2026<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Two: </b><br>Once Prim\u2019s name is pulled, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place in the games. Meanwhile, the boy contestant is Peeta Mellark, who Katniss remembers giving her bread when her family was starving after the death of their father. Together, they are thrown into a competition that no one believes they will be able to come back alive. Especially since only one victor is allowed, therefore one of them will most certainly have to die.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Three: </b><br>Katniss is given her iconic mockingjay pin that will literally change the world as she knows it.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Four: </b><br>Haymitch punches Peeta to make him look rougher, lol. The journey Haymitch is about to take alongside these two kids as their mentor, whew.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Five: </b><br>Cinna (my favorite character), makes Katniss a fire dress in which the world has never seen, and will be the first time the world finds it extremely hard to forget her or her name. Also, unknown to Katniss, a start of a public romance is brewing with Peeta to help their image. We also get to meet President Snow and start to get a vibe of all the evil things he has been stirring up for some time now.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Six: </b><br>Katniss and Peeta make it to the training center and they start to learn about the other candidates from the other districts. We also get to learn about the different privileges of the other districts, and how some of these candidates view this as an honor to volunteer their life for (without needing to save a little sister). We also get to see Rue, and it\u2019s really hard to not feel like you want to reach into the pages and protect her yourself.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Seven: </b><br>Katniss makes quite the impression with an arrow and an apple, that many important people of the Capitol find very hard to ignore.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Eight: </b><br>This is the start of the Peeta versus Gale debate, and the brewing of a very opinionated love-triangle. For me, personally, I always think it\u2019s obvious in Katniss\u2019s inner monologue that she only likes Peeta, but I digress.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Nine: </b><br>We get to meet Caesar Flickerman and see Katniss and Peeta\u2019s vastly different interviews with him. Peeta is coached to very much play the star-crossed lovers card, and he even tells Caesar that he loves Katniss more than anything.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Ten: </b><br>This is the start of Part 2, where they games are finally going to begin. And Cinna says my favorite line in the entire series to Katniss. So simple, so beautiful, so heartbreaking.<b></b><br><br><i>\n  <b>\u201cI'm not allowed to bet, but if I could, I'd bet on you.\u201d</b>\n</i><br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Eleven: </b><br>The twenty-four tributes are entering the game, and in the middle is a cornucopia filled with weapons and supplies\u2026 if you are brave enough to make a run for them. Peeta distracts her at the very start of the game, so Katniss doesn\u2019t go for the bow. And we quickly see that people are starting to form groups to take out some of the weaker players.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Twelve: </b><br>Katniss is proving that she will do whatever it takes to survive.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Thirteen: </b><br>Katniss is still up in a tree, surviving, when she sees Rue and they form a silent plan together.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Fourteen: </b><br>She does get the medicine she needs from someone out there watching her in the world, who is rooting for her and her life. After with the help of some killer, engineered wasps\u2026 she is able to get down from this tree and gets a bow.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Fifteen: </b><br>Katniss teams up with Rue, while they come up with a big plan to make it a little harder for the districts teaming up with all the supplies.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Sixteen: </b><br>Yeah, Katniss blows up the whole cornucopia.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Seventeen: </b><br>Yet, while Katniss and Rue are trying to meet up again with their mockingjay signals, Rue gets killed by a spear. Katniss sings to her, and realizes that nothing will be the same in her life again, no matter how long she has left.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Eighteen: </b><br>Katniss is trying to deal with the hurt and pain and loss as best as she can, but she also is very hard of hearing in one of her ears now. And she also knows that Peeta has been wounded and is missing.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Nineteen: </b><br>But beyond all else, Katniss is a tracker and a hunter, and she quickly looks for Peeta at a water source and finds him. They also share a kiss when they find shelter, and she vows that she is not going to let him die.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Twenty: </b><br>This chapter has some beautiful foreshadowing of giving Peeta some berries.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Twenty-One: </b><br>Basically, at this point, each contestant needs a certain supply very badly, so they place the things they need back in the middle of the map, and Katniss goes to retrieve theirs. She does get very injured in the process but makes it back to heal him. Thresh helped Katniss because of what she did for Rue.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Twenty-Two: </b><br>Peeta takes care of Katniss and they get more care-packages because they are now the Capitol\u2019s OTP and everyone is rooting for them and their romance.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Twenty-Three: </b><br>Thresh dies, and it breaks my heart every time because I highkey always root for him too. District 11 just deserved better. Cato is still alive, still the biggest threat, and still hella annoying. And then we have some more berry foreshadowing when a girl dies eating some.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Twenty-Four: </b><br>Now that there are only three people left (Katniss, Peeta, and Cato) the game makers want them to finally put an end to the 74th Hunger Games once and for all. Kato runs at them, while wolves start running after them.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Twenty-Five: </b><br>And we quickly find out that the wolves are none other than the people who died in the games. Well, I think at least. They for sure have the tributes eyes, and it just makes it extra freaky. But basically, after some fighting and some monologues, Kato is dying to the wolves slowly, but Katniss puts him out of his misery. They were promised earlier that if Katniss and Peeta were the final two of the game that they could both win and live, but now the game makers are trying to change that game right before them. And since they are saying there can only be one victor, Katniss takes a risk with those beloved berries and her an Peeta threaten suicide before all the people watching from the comfort of their own homes.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Twenty-Six: </b><br>But because they need a winner, they decide two is better than none, so they both are able to live. Katniss wakes up in a hospital where her body is healing and she is able to hear out of her one ear again. She gets to see Cinna, and believe that maybe their lives will be normal again. But Katniss quickly realizes that the Capitol is terribly upset that she played with them, and they are not going to ignore her actions in the game.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Twenty-Seven: </b><br>Katniss gets to see Peeta again, and they are forced to watch all the deaths that happened in the game during their winner\u2019s interview. They both have taken so much damage physically and mentally, and they know that Snow is not through hurting them, or the people they love, by a longshot.<br><br><a href=\"https://meltotheany.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Blog</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meltotheany/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/jtotheimin\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Youtube</a> | <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/meltotheany\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ko-fi</a> | <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/meltotheany?si=kHJ5JnLHQsSp23fDe0qxSQ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Spotify</a> | <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/meltotheany\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitch</a> <br><br><b>Trigger and Content Warnings</b> for loss of a parent, animal death(s), abandonment, depression, PTSD depiction, blood depiction, alcoholism, gore, violence, and murder.<br><br>Buddy read with <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7285286-lea-drumsofautumn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Lea</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17352779-johely-astoldbyjohely\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Johely</a>! \u2764",

    "text": "A lot of things are troubling me about The Hunger Games. A lot of things which I more and more perceive and which are not solely connected with this book but with the metaphor behind the words. People attach themselves to fictional freedom without seeing what really something is and which unfortunately is here to stay because you can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep. You can\u2019t make a shift on a deeper level, if the only thing that attracts you to this book is \u2013 a vision of fight, retaliation and the outcome of freedom. Freedom of flesh. <br /><br />In comparison to the freedom of and from your mind which is nowhere to be found. <br /><br />And this is why I detest this book, although detest is such a strong from the ego word. Because the whole purpose of this story is to show how people shouldn\u2019t sacrifice their children for the better of their communities and with the positive outcomes realise that we are so much stronger and yada yada. <br /><br />THE WHOLE PURPOSE of this book should be that there shouldn\u2019t even be in the first place a need to sacrifice members of our society for some other people to be amused. And where after the battle of ''united'' people we heal and repair the damages for the better tomorrow. The society cancer of western civilisation thinking. <br /><br />Heal the damage, never heal the cause of it. <br /><br />But then we wouldn\u2019t be talking here about the same book. We would be discussing how humanity can help each other with being better, with taking responsibility and with being open to each other. <br /><br />And yet imagine this paradox we live in: better, as if the majority of population can even understand that we are in constant blood thirst to achieve peace. With war comes peace. While along the way we are trying to be better and safer. Yet most people deliberately choose to live on the utmost lowest level of their existence. In fear, frightened of itself.<br /><br />And people read books which are so extreme in their bullshit. And people connect with Katniss because she is the heroine. She has managed to outsmart the system. Instead of thinking that she was not even supposed be there in the first place. Because we live in society that does this to their children. <br /><br />''No, we don\u2019t!''<br /><br />''We do...''<br /><br />''But children can learn how to fight.''<br /><br />''You teach them to fight for individual puppeteers. And instead of working on yourself, how to achieve your inner peace, you associate yourself again with the group because it feels better to be in the tortured crowd, instead of being alone and awakened.''<br /><br />''What are you talking about? It is just emo gibberish. Leave Katniss alone. And in the end, it is just a book. Why don\u2019t you want people to read and educate themselves, does everything have to be deep and meaningful, can\u2019t you just relax?''<br /><br />Yes, everything has to be deep and meaningful since we are drowning in shit of meaningless and shallow. The system as it is, the plot of this book is just another evidence to show us how we are controlled. That we are left barren from our true selves which we only find in empathy, love towards each other and genuinely understanding that we are one and everything is one. But on this provincial&amp;marginal&amp;primitive&amp;emotional level, so many took this book for granted. <br /><br />And the only reason I am writing this review here, the only reason I am giving it so much attention is to tell what is on my mind since it is so widely popular and since I have read it. And one of the main reasons why I can\u2019t really keep things light and popsy is because so many things are already deep down in gutter light and popsy and mainstream. As if having money is any critieria for life, as if not having your own free will and education and information means nothing. And the other side of the rich coin is poverty with people who believe in symbols, who are sidetracked with religions, censured TV, economy and utter lack of information circulation. <br /><br />And a lot of people here are trying to disregard this review and want to reassure me that I am so terribly wrong. BUT, you have yet not seen what I am talking about and it is perfectly OK. <br /><br />So I followed as well screaming Goodreads recommendations and I bought a book that is stupid, violent and written so plainly but of course written for vast masses so they can be touched by fake social awareness. Because it is fake, but most of all it\u2019s tragic. <br /><br />And this is not a critique toward Collins, in my nature of a thinker and seeing her a person who shared her thoughts and which millions of people loved and connected with, I am still a firm believer that the general public just didn\u2019t understand what she was talking about. And this is my silver lining. Because it has been like this throughout centuries and with the biggest thinkers of our civilisation. What they meant and wanted to show, is definitely not what most of the public projected. <br /><br />Because the mainstream public is a group of sheep, not seeing anything properly, but following and like a Tarzan, screaming, don\u2019t you dare stealing my Jane from me. As a metaphor, don\u2019t you dare telling me these uplifting emotions are not true, when all in me about this book tells me that is correct and how people should live their lives. <br /><br />And if the mainstream likes it, uh, then definitely that is not what it\u2019s true. <br /><br />It is just a constant reminder how so many things are left unrecognised while these superficial stories which evoke cheap emotions are always so hugely praised. It could have been just a little story but never underestimate the obese octopus that is called In God And Country We Trust - code red mentality. Mentality of humans which are too ignorant, beautifully naive and untouched basically with what is means to be socially aware. <br /><br />And although this is a teen book, it is more deeply hurting and sickening because if you want to influence somebody, of course you will influence the children \u2013 and yet there is nothing that children can learn from it. They can learn some things, we all need little courageous Katniss, but on a deeper subtler level is it just an intravenous injection of more Nothing and more Numbing and more Disconnected. <br /><br />At least they read is one of the arguments. And argument as fruitfull as at least they eat GMO food. One food for the blind intellect, other for the digestion which both results in basic survival without any interference of you in all of it. Because it takes courage and guts and a pinch of anarchy to stop, turn around and start questioning what is handed. <br /><br />For me, the thought about giving this to a child is sickening especially because we live in this world where all the life criterias are upside down. Because a child will not learn how things are vile and disturbing because Katniss told them through her delusional and hyperventilating focus, but a child will learn about life\u2019s cruelty, and it will be touched by it sooner or later, by questioning everything that is served in front of it. <br /><br />Because if it is served somebody is earning money and you are just getting fatter and sicker. <br /><br />And the children will learn how to question if you teach them how to find not if you broadcast them the answers. Not if you teach them through aggressive examples and if you keep the nation in cold sweat especially if you are lucky enough to live in the countries where oppression is not the issue but consumerism, body image and mediocrity have you on the leash. <br /><br />I am astonished with a fact that around 75.000 Goodreads members read this book and that around 50.000 of them rated it 5 stars. What is it that fascinates them so much. <br /><br />It\u2019s disturbing because people obviously associate and find themselves in this book. And it's about a girl Katniss Everdeen, living in the far away future, who was chosen to participate in a cruel Big Brother game, in which 24 contestants (children age 12-18) kill each other, because live TV has become demanding, and the public loves reality blood and violence. That's it. A little bit of undeveloped and unbelievable romance between her and two boys, a little bit of her abandoned family problems, a little bit of The 5th element movie political structure, mutants and pop stylists. It\u2019s so screwed up. <br /><br />In the beginning, first 50 pages were well written. There was suspense, Katniss was sweet and witty, but overall this book is a shitty meltdown. Adding the ridiculous cliffhanger ending. Some people here are using words like dystopian literature, and then write essays about how this book is the core of it. <br /><br />The core is pointlessly graphic and sadistic, without any concrete message except of the negative: this book is just proving that the world today is fucked up if this book is so successful. I don\u2019t see the point of reading about the fictional kids who are doing this to each other. <br /><br />In a metaphorical way it is promoting political establishments of certain countries and that is getting tiring. Not all people are eager to swallow the shit of general brainwashing. Katniss being the heroine (ironical quote marks). Being loyal and darling and a role model. Just wake up. Life is happening and some pretty dark things are happening while you are thinking that Katniss is the representative of the club called liberation. <br /><br />For me, in a bookish way it stands for one bad one night stand, kiss and forget. But as always, readers tend to bring fiction to their real life and just as many think that kittens and superheroes are comfort zones, a lot of readers perceive this plot as their own little shrine. <br /><br />But that is me not being in tune with the mainstream population which is too distracted with billboards. <br /><br />Because it is easier, because why protest, why not simply take what you are given - eat your GMO Monsanto's company hamburgers, eat your cancer giving Nestle products and think that The Hunger Games are the best franchise ever, like ever. If you don't have any arguments about real life activism and if you think that there is deepness in this plot which I have yet not seen so you need to enlightened me, just include North Korea or Hitler or ISIS(L) or those poor people who are closed in Zara hangers who work nonstop ''somewhere'' in the world because obviously you are aware of the crisis although you don\u2019t think you could show on the map but you have heard somewhere on Murdoch media. <br /><br />This shit sells. It's genuinely bad but excellently targeted. You know, it evokes pride and loyalty and massacring children, freedom and scandal and Hollywood. It goes very well with all the Kardashian filth. As long as it sells, sells, sells. And marketing agencies know that people are united when they are jealous, when they want and they with those hamburgers want freedom. Nobody is going to kill their Katniss in a goddam book! Really? Take a look around you. <br /><br />And then the punch line for this book comes from the so called activism from the shopping mall. People who devour literature of this kind and think that everything is all right while in the same time, fuck, you are getting oozingly fat. <br /><br />Bottom line.<br /><br />This book is very shallow and MTV culture oriented, like a classical example of easy consummated pop-literature; I'm very surprised that it didn't come with some trash magazine subscription. If it doesn't have savage brutality, prize money and prefix ''media coverage'' then it won't be appealing and educational because surely this is how children of 21st century survive this techno media world; through examples of true moral issues and realistic outcomes. Have another gulp of Coca-Cola along the way while you listen to dubstep shit. <br /><br />It saddens me when a violent hillbillish book is so popular. What is there to truly identify yourself with. Except if your chicken soup for soul are basic emotions which come with buy 1 get 1 free.<br />",

    "text": "I read this when it was first published, ordering it before I knew it was YA, and years before any films (which I've not seen). If I were a teenager or recommending this to a teen, I might give it 3*; as an adult, I give it 2*.<br /><br />PLOT<br /><br />It's a potentially exciting but gruesome story, but most of the characters were rather flat, and much of the plot was predictable, partly because it's not hugely original. See Shirley Jackson's <b>The Lottery</b>, which I reviewed <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2084179141\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">HERE</a>, and the Japanese <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/57891.Battle_Royale\" title=\"Battle Royale by Koushun Takami\" rel=\"noopener\">Battle Royale</a>. Furthermore, there were too many flaws in the plot. I fail to understand its very high ratings.<br /><br />Post-apocalyptic America (Panem) is divided into a wealthy and technologically advanced Capitol and twelve subsidiary districts of oppressed people who exist in dire poverty, with inadequate food, housing, and health care and hardly any technology. To reinforce the power of the Capitol by instilling fear in the population, once a year, two children from each region are selected by lots to fight to the death in a reality show. If that were not bad enough, the whole thing is utterly corrupt in multiple ways, plus the public bet on the outcome, and sponsors can sway the results. Did I mention these are <b>children</b>? (Some are as young as 12, though the narrator is 16.) A compulsory full-body wax on a teen seems rather pervy and who would want to bet on, let alone sponsor a child-killing tournament, even if it's by helping one of the contestants? As the book keeps reminding readers, one person's survival is only possible by the death of <b>all</b> the others.<br /><br />CRUELTY TO CHILDREN<br /><br />I realise that horrendous things are done to children around the world every day (extreme poverty, child soldiers, sexual assault, genital mutilation etc), but in none of those cases is the <b>sole intention</b> that <b>all</b> but one child dies, and nor is it organised by the <b>government</b> for a sick combination of sport, entertainment, punishment and profit. <br /><br />Humans often lack compassion, but I was never convinced by Collins' world - especially the fact this outrage has continued for <b>three generations</b> (it's the 74th games), apparently without the Capitol even needing to invoke gods or supernatural powers to justify their cruelty! Could a barbaric annual tournament really be such a powerful incentive not to rise up in all that time? (I don't think so.)<br /><br />BIG ISSUES<br /><br />Nevertheless, it tackles some big themes that are particularly pertinent to teens: the nature of friendship; divided loyalties; the difference between love and friendship; who to trust; whether the ends justify the means; the need to repay favours; the danger of power, wealth and celebrity; the corrupting influence of reality TV; the need for independence, and whether you can trust a parent who abandons you. <br /><br />It all feels rather laboured to me, but it might not if I were a teen, which only reinforces my puzzlement at the number of adults who have enjoyed it. I must be missing something.<br /><br />NARRATIVE STRUCTURE <br /><br />Nearly half the book is backstory and preparation for the games; the remainder is a tale of hunter and hunted. I predicted the main plot twist less than a quarter of the way in (and the fact that Katniss is telling the story limits the possible outcomes), but the suspense was broken when it was made explicit way before the end. There are some other twists between then and the final page, but by then I was rather annoyed with the whole thing.<br /><br />IMPLAUSIBILITY AND INCONSISTENCIES<br /><br /><b>If</b> I'd enjoyed the book more, I would have found it easier to suspend my disbelief, but as it was, I was constantly irked by questions and inconsistencies. <br /><br />* The contestants (and their parents and grandparents) have been forced to watch the games every year of their lives. I suppose they had become inured to it, but on the other hand, that meant they <b>knew</b> the horror of it. I just didn't believe there was as little fear in them as there appeared to be - given that they are children. <br />* Participants don't want other participants to know where they are, yet sponsor gifts occasionally drop out of the sky, via silver parachute; not a risk, apparently. <br />* It's all filmed by numerous invisible floating cameras (I can buy that), but that somehow includes filming inside a cave that is virtually sealed (I can't). <br />* How (and why) would any of these participants be able to measure time to within half hour intervals?<br />* How big is Panem? It can only be a tiny part of the USA because each district specialises in only one thing (coal mining, agriculture etc) and has just one town square that can accommodate everyone (8,000 people in District 12) and yet it's a day's train journey from District 12 to the Capitol. It doesn't seem like a very plausible settlement pattern in a post-disaster world, even given the totalitarian regime (concentrating people in a few centres makes it easier to observe and perhaps control them, but it also creates more opportunities for opposition movements to develop).<br /><br />COMPARED WITH LORD OF THE FLIES<br /><br />There are some similarities with \"Lord of the Flies\" (my review here: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/47291441\">http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...</a>), but although \"The Hunger Games\" is likely to have more appeal to modern teens, I think there are (at least) two crucial differences:<br /><br />* In LotF one person's survival is not necessarily at the cost of everyone else's. (It is even possible that they could all survive.)<br /><br />* LotF has much more depth and symbolism: it tackles original sin; the mystical \"Beast\"; leadership, tribal allegiance and group dynamics (including bullying and attitudes to difference and minor disability) and the importance of ritual and belief.<br /><br />The second point is what makes LotF a better book, in my opinion. <br /><br />Of course, there are other, more obvious, parallels with extreme \"reality\" shows such as \"Survivor\" and \"I'm a Celebrity, get me out of here\", but the fundamental differences are not just that contestants in those shows do not fear for their lives, but that they are adults who have <b>chosen</b> to enter. <br /><br />I TRIED TO ENJOY IT!<br /><br />Any fans who read this will now hate me. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I read it all the way through, making notes as usual, but to no avail. Sorry.",

    "text": "For a long time now, I\u2019ve wanted to rewrite my review of <i>The Hunger Games</i> so that I could tell you why I don\u2019t just love this series, but why I also think it\u2019s important. It is beautiful for the unflinching way it shows you, as a reader, your own willingness to disregard people who are different from you - how you are the Capitol audience. But, it is important as a story about girls. I had not initially thought about articulating that point because it seemed so obvious to me, and I am bad at recognizing my own assumptions. Lately, though, I have seen so many people, both men and women, acting as though this remarkable book is a piece of fluff that I realized maybe what I love most about <i>The Hunger Games</i> is not as obvious as it seems. To me, this series is important because it is a landmark departure from the traditional story about girls.<br /><br />Too often, stories objectify women. But the word \u201cobjectify,\u201d I\u2019ve realized, has almost no meaning for someone who has either not experienced objectification or who hasn\u2019t really recognized it in her own life, so I\u2019m going to be more descriptive here. When I say stories objectify girls, I mean they <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5470.1984\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">talk</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3876.The_Sun_Also_Rises\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">about</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7588.A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">girls</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70401.On_the_Road\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">as</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44796.The_Moon_And_Sixpence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">though</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43641.Water_for_Elephants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">they</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/930.Memoirs_of_a_Geisha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">are</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9sd05S0hBM&amp;feature=fvst\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">fleshlights</a> that sometimes have handy dandy extra gadgets such as an <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4667024-the-help\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">all-purpose cleaning mechanism</a> and <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41865.Twilight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">food dispensing function</a>. <br /><br />Sidebar: if you are inclined to now google the word \"fleshlight,\" I encourage you to consult the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fleshlight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">urban dictionary definition here</a> before doing that, as the google results will probably be NSFW and also NSF those of you whose parents might check your browsing history. Do parents know how to do that? Sorry for the sidebar, I am just intending to make an explicit point, and now I am feeling uncomfortable about what that explicit point might mean to the target audience of this book. Girls, you are probably badass like Katniss, and you are definitely <i>not</i> a fleshlight. <br /><br />Back to my rant about typical objectification in storytelling: often the <s>girls</s> fleshlights have <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4671.The_Great_Gatsby\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">fancy outer designs</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8525590-wither\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> because it makes the fleshlights happy to be fancy</a>. Sometimes they have <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6867.Atonement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">skeeeeeery castration functions</a>, and other times they work as <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/968.The_Da_Vinci_Code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">helpful databases</a> for <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/285092.High_Fidelity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">music</a> or <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/954674.Little_Brother\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">video games</a> or <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6186357-the-maze-runner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">whatever UR into</a>. A lot of times, I will hear people refer to this type of objectification as treating women like they are just a vagina, or a pair of boobs, but I think there is something to the stories that is less human and more sexbot machine than that complaint covers.<br /><br />So, in all of those links, I have tried to include books written by men and by women because I think that women think of ourselves this way almost as often as men think of us this way. The link from <i>The Ugly Truth</i>, for example, shows both a man and a woman treating women like fleshlights. I have also included both books I love and books I hate because, ultimately, I do think girls adopt this story about themselves, and I also think we can pretty easily identify with a male protagonist and disregard female characters who look nothing like humans. For example, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> is one of my favorite books in the whole world, even though it does not contain any women who resonate with my experience of humans. And I don't think it's necessarily bad that I can enjoy stories where women are only fleshlights, as long as I can still be whoever I want to be without a positive role model. I think it's good to enjoy stories and take what we can get from them, and so I don't regret that I love <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>.<br /><br />In seeing some male reactions to <i>The Hunger Games</i>, I am reminded that most men do not identify with female protagonists the way women have been trained to identify with male protagonists. This seems like a huge disadvantage for men to be in, to me, and if you are a man reading this review, I would ask you to check out your bookshelves. How many female authors are on your shelves? How many of the books those authors wrote have no central male character? If you have a minute after that, check the shelves of a woman you are friends with and see how many of her books were written by men or have no central female character. Odds are the results will be pretty different.<br /><br /><i>The Hunger Games</i> is such a groundbreaking and deliberate example of a woman\u2019s perspective on war and family and even men that it floors me. I think it partly floors me because, other than <i>Buffy</i>, I can\u2019t think of another example of a female character who really fights for herself in such an obvious and hopeful way. Katniss is strong and broken, and powerful in her brokenness. Collins\u2019s image of a woman\u2019s perspective is not, admittedly, as effortless as Moira Young\u2019s in <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/9917938.Blood_Red_Road__Dust_Lands___1_\" title=\"Blood Red Road (Dust Lands, #1) by Moira Young\" rel=\"noopener\">Blood Red Road</a>, but its deliberateness has its own value. <br /><br />It is not an accident that the story shows Katniss\u2019s emotional growth and that Peeta, as a more emotionally whole person, facilitates her emotional growth. It is not an accident that the story does not discuss the effect Katniss has on the erectness of Peeta\u2019s and Gale\u2019s penises. The first is not an accident because in reality, men do not have to be the emotional cowards that the stories I\u2019ve linked to above make them out to be. Masculinity does not have to mean emotional cowardice. The second is not an accident because the story is not from Peeta and Gale\u2019s perspectives. Despite widespread rumors to the contrary, it is my experience that women pretty seldom think about their effect on men\u2019s penises. Hopefully, we <i>never</i> think of our primary purpose in life, in the way so many stories think of it, as making penises erect. Hopefully, we never think of ourselves as gadgets that are super fun for other people.<br /><br />There are so many reasons I love <i>The Hunger Games</i> series, and all of this is one I wouldn\u2019t have initially even thought to say. I saw this Eleanor Roosevelt quote earlier this month, and it said, \u201cIt is better to light one small candle than to curse the darkness.\u201d I think <i>The Hunger Games</i> is a candle in the overall dark narrative of girls\u2019 perspective on life. Yes, it is also a poignant critique of reality TV and Western callousness about the catastrophes caused by industrialization in the developing world, but that, too, resonates with me in many ways because of its remarkably feminine voice. It absolutely makes sense to me that this book is not for everyone because of its violence, but I still think that it is objectively important because it shows a perspective that seems authentically feminine to me \u2013 that talks like a girl, not like a sexy, fancy gadget. I\u2019m not saying that in my opinion girls don\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t ever think about being sexy or erect penises, I\u2019m just saying that it is my experience that we think and care about many, many more things than penises, clean houses, and food, and very, very few stories are willing to tell you about that. The <i>Hunger Games</i> is one that does, and it does so in way that is beautiful and important. ",

I don't know why I didn't when it was a series that completely took over my life for a short while. But recently I've been thinking about posting something in this review space and after just watching the second film (which I think was amazing and better than the first), now seems like as good a time as any to talk about why I love Katniss and nearly everything about this series.<br><br>I gave this book four stars back in 2011 and I'm going to leave that rating as it is because it's an indicator of my thoughts at the time (though they slightly differ now) - thoughts which were influenced by having just finished the fantastic, horrifying, brutal and unforgettable <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/57891.Battle_Royale\" title=\"Battle Royale by Koushun Takami\" rel=\"noopener\">Battle Royale</a> manga series. I don't think it was the best time for myself and Katniss to find one another when I had so much beautiful insanity to compare the book to, but it still managed to have such an effect on me that I instantly told every friend and family member to read it. Coming back to this now after having spent the last couple of years being bombarded with dystopian YA, I appreciate what Collins has achieved a whole lot more. <br><br>I appreciate the strength of Katniss as a heroine who commands our attention and holds our love whilst still being what some would consider unlikable; I appreciate the balance of beauty and horror that Collins delivers on every page, treating us constantly to both the darkest despair and rays of hope; and I also - amazingly - appreciate the love triangle. Love triangles seem to have chased me and hunted me down with every YA read I picked up over the last two or three years - my dislike for romance instantly becoming doubled by the introduction of yet another boy with beautiful eyes. But Katniss, Peeta and Gale worked for me. They convinced me, held my interest and made me cry. The love triangle worked because it's outcome wasn't obvious, because we all wondered and hoped and worried. <b>Because, either way, I was always going to be half happy and half sad.</b><br><br>Katniss still remains for me everything that a female protagonist should be. Or a female hero, at least. She fights for the ones she loves, she's brave and doesn't need to be saved. But neither is she a one-dimensional smiling poster-version of a heroine. She falls, she fails, people get hurt because of her and she has to live with that. We love her and yet she's antisocial, awkward and moody. She loves other people with all her heart but she's not much of a team player. In short: she's a complex portrait of a young woman that doesn't fall into any neatly defined boxes or categories. Now, perhaps, authors have since tried to recreate her. But she's still one of the first and best.<br><br>I know another review of this book isn't needed. I know you've all probably read it anyway. Or never will. But this isn't really for anyone else; it's a reminder to myself of why this book deserves its hype and why I need to remember to come back to it again and again between the new (and hopefully amazing) YA books I'll be reading in the future.",

    "text": "<b>Already Want to Read This Again\u2026\u2026</b><br /><br />Wow! That was amazing! <br /><br />Yes, yes. I\u2019ve already seen the movie, but the book is so much better.<br /><br />In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is scraping by, just trying to make her daily living, hunting by her bow in the forest to feed her family. Every year, The Capitol requires every district to offer up one boy and one girl as tributes. The tributes fight each other to the death until only one person survives. This fight is called The Hunger Games.<br /><br />The day of the Reaping finally comes. This is the day where the one boy and one girl are selected. Unfortunately, Prim, Katniss\u2019s younger sister is selected. In an incredible act of bravery, Katniss volunteers to take her sister\u2019s place. Will Katniss make it through The Hunger Games?<br /><br />First of all, the narrator on this was perfect. She even did the accent for the Capitol people, and she sang the song. <br /><br />Second, The Hunger Games is a perfect dystopian novel. It has different dresses and customs, but it isn\u2019t overkill or confusing. <br /><br />There are also many parallels to today\u2019s society. For example, why do the citizens allow The Hunger Games? Because they don\u2019t believe that their children will be selected. How many people believe that they will never be unemployed, never get divorced, never become seriously ill or injured? People like betting on themselves. But we, as a society, aren\u2019t we better off if we made sure that there were strong safety nets in place for those who happen on hard times? <br /><br />In The Hunger Games, all is also not equal. The tributes can have sponsors who rain down much needed supplies on the tributes. We like to think that everyone has an equal opportunity. But is that really the case when the rich can purchase private ACT/SAT tutors for their children? What about those who start their first job and have strong allies and mentors from day one? <br /><br />But I also loved this book, because it had many small acts of kindness.<br /><br /><i>\u201cKind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there.\u201d \u2013 The Hunger Games</i><br /><br />With cruelty becoming commonplace, kindness stands out. When District 11 came together, I racked my brain trying to remember the last time that we, as a society, came together for a cause, and I came up short. I think the world is hungry for a rallying cry, a cause that we can all fight together for. What would the world be like if the cruelty was replaced by kindness? Full disclosure: may have cried just a little bit reading this.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next book in the series\u2026.<br /><br />-\tThe Girl On Fire<br /><br /><b>Connect With Me!</b><br /><a href=\"https://lisaoftroy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Blog</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lisa_of_Troy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitter</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmSewQ0IGOzDnuMZNUKTbg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">BookTube</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LisaofTroy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Facebook</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisa_of_troy/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Insta</a>",

He protected her but I will admit she protected him as well! She risked her life to get the medicine needed to heal his leg. But how can she not see that he is madly in love with her?

    "text": "I LOVE THIS BOOK! I've said to a few people that if I wasn't married, I'd have to marry this book. :) I read the 400 page ARC in a less-than-24-hour time period (so quickly that it was never even on my \"currently reading\" shelf), which I've only done before with HP books, and I've just officially put the first book on my 2008 favorites shelf. I feel pretty safe in saying that if this isn't still my favorite book of the year when next January rolls around, that I'll eat a hat. As soon as I finished reading it, I turned around and read it a 2nd time, which I've never done before in my life. I loved all of Collins' GREGOR books, and think she's a wonderful writer, but she's ratcheted it up to another level with this one. Even though it's the first in a trilogy, this one definitely stands alone, and I'm not sure how she can keep it up for another 2 books, but I suppose it's possible (think: THE GIVER, although I loved GATHERING BLUE, and liked THE MESSENGER--HUNGER GAMES is much more brutal than THE GIVER, though). It's got some very meaty issues to chew on, not the least of which is reality TV taken to extremes. There's a chaste and unresolved romance (think: TWILIGHT, but I don't think I will make it past the first in that series--HUNGER GAMES has much more action, more of a plot, lots of well-developed secondary characters, as well as extremely likeable main characters. I will miss Katniss until I can read about her again.). What more could you possibly ask for out of a book? It doesn't actually come out until October 2008, but if you can get your hands on an ARC, definitely do! I think that the violence in this will be easier for kids to take, since they probably won't see it quite as clearly as an adult will. None of it is particularly graphic, but it is definitely brutal. This is on the edge of too dark for me, which is my favorite kind of book. There aren't many writers who can push it right to the edge for me without going over (Zusak comes to mind immediately), but Collins is definitely one of them. Another book that I loved, and think of to compare this to is HOUSE OF THE SCORPION, but that fell apart slightly at the end for me. HUNGER GAMES didn't lack anything at all for me. OK, I'll stop gushing. I may have to re-write this review when I get some perspective. (2012: Obviously, I never did rewrite it, and this is my most-\"liked\" review :) <br /><br />My 10 1/2 yr old son asked to read this with me, so I read it for the 3rd time with him in Oct 2008. Still my definite favorite book of the year, but all the typos in the finished book were pretty disappointing. Still, it's my choice for just about any award out there, come January, including the JHUNT. <br /><br />Update May 2009: I am dying because the CATCHING FIRE ARC has just been released, and people are saying it's at least as good at HG. I've had 2 teenaged boys at my library read this on my recommendation, and both of them came back asking me for more books like it (really there isn't anything). One of them has pre-ordered CATCHING FIRE on Amazon (updated to say that I worked in a fairly disadvantaged neighborhood in DC at the time, so that was not a usual occurrence). <br /><br />May-June 2011: I'm reading this for the 4th time, with my younger son, who's finishing up 5th grade. Still as good as ever!! Can't wait for the movie!!<br /><br />Update 2012: Between them, HG and CATCHING FIRE were the pinnacle of my 20-yr career as a YA librarian! I've seen the movie twice so far, and definitely liked it better the 2nd time, when it didn't have to try to be my favorite book. :)<br /><br />Update 2020: It's been 9 years since I last read this, but I've never listened to the audiobook, so I decided that having it read to me would be a good activity during the covid-19 pandemic. STILL as good as ever, and the odds will forever be in its favor.",

    "text": "<u>personal anecdote</u> - the first time i heard of this book was when i was 17. i was at work (i was a hostess at a restaurant in a mall) and my manager came up to me, gave me $20 and asked me to run to B&amp;N to buy her a copy before they closed. she wanted me to do it because she said it <i>'would look better if a teenager bought it.'</i><br /><br />i havent really thought about that day since but, since my time on goodreads, i cant believe how much shaming i see for adults who read books that are targeted for YA or children. what a shame it is that adults feel embarrassed to buy a book simply because its promoted as a story for teenagers!<br /><br />as i reread this, 10 years later, i am even more convinced that people should read whatever they want to read and not feel bad for enjoying what they enjoy! <br /><br />also, gale totally deserves better. i thought it then and i still think it now. my boy is the true hero of this story. <br /><br />and that has been your PSA for the day!<br /><br /><b>\u21a0 <i>5 stars</i></b>",

    "text": "Fantastically Written? Ooooh yeah! Compelling? Yup! Super Quick Read? Most definitely! Original? Um...well *shuffles feet, since I seem to be a rare non-five star-er* not original at all really.... <br /><br />Man, I wish someone on my friends list here has also read Battle Royale and this book! The Hunger Games WAS pretty fantastic, hence the four stars (though I would have given 3 1/2 if the choice was available.) I ate it up, shouting into other rooms and offices that I was going to be shoving the book into their hands as soon as I was done, but as it went on desha vu was a little too common for me. I know there are major story types out there, ones that are repeated over and over again. Shakespeare retold 200 different ways. The bible reinterpreted to 2,000,000 varieties of tales....but when it comes to YA dystopia, which is by far my favorite genre of any book, originality is one of my main ways I judge a book. FEED felt utterly original. The world of UGLIES felt new. LITTLE BROTHER was just plain amazing. If it's going to be about \"the future\" we don't know about, make it original. In my mind dystopia novels survive on \"idea\" more than \"excecution\" and while the execution of this was beautiful, the idea was hardly new. <br /><br />While I have a really good feeling Collins never read, or maybe even heard of, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games was 90% the plot of Battle Royal, minus the guns, the extra blood, the ability to get to know all the other players. In Battle Royal (short explanation of BR plot: 40 students put on island forced to kill each other and winner is set for life and put on TV etc...), the main focus is a love story between two students trapped in the game, two students bonding together with no real urge to kill others...one of whom had a crush on the other forever and it is only revealed during the game. There are so many other similarities, from the ways the gamemakers manipulate, to the ways the media encourages, to one character having a fever and the other taking care of them with soup. There are even \"career\" battle royal players. In BR you see the emotions before and after someone is killed, their last thoughts, the feeling of the person who killed. It's actually really beautiful the way it is done, and so believable that put in an arena teens WOULD turn into savages. In The Hunger Games, yes the main characters were fantastic, and many of the lesser as well, but Foxface is only Foxface, and the Careers are never more than random 1-dimensional bad guys. <br /><br />The Hunger Games was very Battle Royale, very The Long Walk (Richard Bachman book), and very much current reality shows. I am not saying it wasn't a GREAT read, I'm just saying it shouldn't shake the publishing earth the way I am pretty sure it is going to. I anticipate this is the next Twilight series people are going to gush over. In a few years we'll all be hosting Hunger Games final book parties. I'll be amongst the attendees I'm sure. <br /><br />Also in terms of female main characters, Katiniss may surpass Bella in me wanting to shake sense into a character. Talk about a smart girl being utterly clueless! <br /><br />Yes, it was great, but eh, maybe I'm just bitter because I think BR is the better book of the two and while Hunger Games will get tons of praise and likely a rather deserved award or two, BR will continue to be banned in many libraries. Amazing what subtracting guns can do to a story. Suddenly it doesn't feel as violent, but rather is more reminiscent of stories we heard growing up. The number of swords and arrow deaths in traditional fairytales is nothing to freak out about, but if bullets are flying, it will give \"too many ideas\" to teens and therefore must be dubbed an adult book. <br /><br />I'm pretty sure if I hadn't read BR just a few months back this exeedingly long review would have been just as long only instead of a rant it would have just been one long squeeeeeal of delight over how much I loved the book. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Original Comment: Peer pressure, peer pressure, peer pressure. Geez guys! Alright, alright I'll read it!<br />",

    "text": "Clearly Gregor was merely the prelude. Suzanne Collins, you\u2019ve been holding out on us, missy. As an author we were accustomed to your fun adventures involving a boy, his sister, and a world beneath our world. I think it's fair to say that we weren\u2019t really expecting something like <i>The Hunger Games</i>. At least I wasn\u2019t. But reading it gave me a horribly familiar feeling. There is a certain strain of book that can hypnotize you into believing that you are in another time and place roughly 2.3 seconds after you put that book down. <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/213753.Life_As_We_Knew_It__Last_Survivors___1_\" title=\"Life As We Knew It (Last Survivors, #1) by Susan Beth Pfeffer\" rel=\"noopener\"> Life As We Knew It</a> by Susan Beth Pfeffer could convince me that there were simply not enough canned goods in my home. And <i>The Hunger Games</i>? Well as I walked down the street I was under the disctinc impression that there were hidden cameras everywhere, charting my progress home. Collins has written a book that is exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns. It ascends to the highest forms of the science fiction genre and will create all new fans for the writer. One of the best books of the 2008 year.<br />\t<br />Life in District 12 isn\u2019t easy for Katniss and her family. Ever since her father died the girl has spent her time saving her mother and little sister Prim from starvation by hunting on forbidden land. But worst of all is reaping day. Once a year the government chooses two children from each of the twelve districts to compete against one another in a live and televised reality show. Twenty-four kids and teens enter, and only one survives. When Prim's name is called, Katniss exchanges herself without hesitation to compete alongside the baker\u2019s boy Peeta. To survive in this game you need to win the heart of your audience, and so District 12\u2019s trainers come up with a plan. Why not make it as if Peeta and Katniss were in love with one another? But in a game where only one person can live, Katniss will have to use all her brains, wits, and instincts to determine who to trust and how to outwit the game's creators.<br />\t<br />I described the plot of this book to my husband, particularly the part where Katniss and Peeta fake being in love to gain the audience\u2019s approval and the very first thing he said was, \u201cOh! That\u2019s the plot of <i>They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?</i>\" Then I mentioned that it took place in the future and that government leaders set up teenagers to fight one another to the death and he said, \"<i>Battle Royale</i>\u201d. So sure, there are parts of this plot that have been done before. You could say it's <i>The Game</i> meets <i>Spartacus</i> with some <i>Survivor</i> thrown in for spice. But that\u2019s not what makes a book good or bad, is it? Some of the greatest works of literature out there, regardless of the readerships' age, comes about when an author takes overdone or familiar themes and then makes them entirely new through the brilliance of their own writing. Harry Potter wouldn\u2019t have been any great shakes if it weren\u2019t for Rowling\u2019s storytelling. Similarly, Collins takes ideas that have certainly seen the light of day before and concocts an amazingly addictive text. About the time you get to the fifth chapter that ends with a sentence that forces you to read on, you\u2019re scratching your head wondering how the heck she <i>DOES</i> that.<br />\t<br />Your story often rests on the shoulders of the protagonist. Is this a believable character? Do you root for him or her? Because basically it is a very hard thing to create a \u201cgood\u201d person on the page that your reader is going to fall in love with. Because we readers know that we are flawed, we are often inclined to side with the similarly flawed people we meet between a book\u2019s covers. Katniss, on the other hand, is so good in so many ways. She sacrifices herself for her sister. She tries to save people in the game. But there\u2019s almost a jock mentality to her too. Katniss can figure out the puzzles and problems in the game, but when it comes to emotional complexity she\u2019s sometimes up a tree. Most remarkable to me was the fact that Katniss could walk around, oblivious to romance, and not bug me. Seriously, nothing gets under my skin faster than heroines who can\u2019t see that their fellow fellas are jonesing for them. You just want to bonk the ladies upside the head with a brick or something. The different here is maybe the fact that since Katniss knows that Peeta has to play a part, she uses that excuse (however unconsciously) to justify his seeming affection for her. Thems smart writing.<br />\t<br />Oh! And did I mention the dialogue at all? The humor? Yep, there\u2019s humor. We\u2019re talking about a story where adolescents hunger for blood, and Katniss is getting in lines about her trainers like, \u201cAnd then, because it\u2019s Effie and she\u2019s apparently required by law to say something awful...\u201d Good stuff. The words pop off the page. And then there\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re dealing with a dystopian novel where the author has somehow managed to create a believable future. No faux slang here, or casual references to extinct dolphins. There are some animals that were scientifically altered, but you can\u2019t have a future without a couple cool details like that, right?<br />\t<br />In general, this book throws a big fat wrench into the boy book/girl book view of child/teen literature. People love to characterize books by gender. It stars a boy? Boy book. A girl? Girl book. Now take a long lengthy look at the first book in the <i>Hunger Games Trilogy</i>. It stars a girl... and a boy too. There\u2019s a lot of hunting, fighting, and survival... and a lot of romance, kisses, and cool outfits. There\u2019s strategy, the world\u2019s most fabulous fashion designer, weapons and a girl who knows how to fight. This is not a book that quietly slots into our preconceived stereotypes. And you know what happens to books that span genders? They sell very well indeed. That is, if you can get both boys and girls to read them.<br />\t<br />The age range? Well, for most of this story I would have said ten and up. I mean, yeah the basic premise is that a lot of teenagers go around killing one another, and sure there\u2019s some romance to deal with, but none of it really seems inappropriate... until a final death scene appears in the book. I won\u2019t give any details, but suffice it to say it is gruesome. There are definite horror elements to it as well, so with that in mind I am upping my recommendation to 12 and up. I\u2019m sure that there are 10-year-olds out there who\u2019ve seen much worse stuff on cable, just as there are 12-year-olds who\u2019ll freak out ten pages in. Still, I\u2019m more comfortable recommending it for the older kids rather than the younger. You'll see why.<br />\t<br />It occurs to me that there has never been a quintessential futuristic gladiator book for kids. That is undoubtedly the roughest term you can give this book. Now I\u2019m not a person who cries easily when she reads something, particularly something for kids. Yet as I was taking a train to Long Island I found myself tearing up over significant parts of this story. It\u2019s good. And it\u2019s so ridiculous that a work of science fiction like this could even be so good. You think of futuristic arena tales and your mind instantly sinks to the lowest common denominator. What Collins has done here is set up a series that will sink its teeth into readers. The future of this book will go one of two ways. Either it will remain an unappreciated cult classic for years to come or it will be fully appreciated right from the start and lauded. My money lies with the latter. A contender in its own right.<br /><br />Ages 12 and up.<br />",

    "text": "spoilers but do y\u2019all remember that scene in book two where all of the victors are being interviewed and keep saying shit that cuts right to the capitol\u2019s bone, all really purposefully overdramatic, and then right after Katniss gets up and that shit with the Dress happens (which she instantly knows is a life sacrifice one of her only friends is making for her) Peeta gets up on that stage and makes a normal speech and then ends it with \u201cI\u2019d be fine, if it weren\u2019t for the baby\u201d like when is literature ever going to reach those peaks of bad bitch energy ever again<br /><br />I think this series is so fascinating in that it basically spurred an entire genre of sort-of-okay YA dystopians and then a lot of really bad YA dystopians, and it gets put a lot into that category. but... <b>this book doesn\u2019t have any of those same problems that so plagued YA dystopian fiction.</b><br /><br />The love triangle being pointless is <i>quite literally the point</i>; Gale and Peeta are meant to represent the opposite sides of war (something a certain plot point in book three really drives home). Katniss is frankly never romantically interested in either for almost <i>all</i> of books one and two; she grows to care about Peeta in the general sense, not just the romantic sense. The eventual romance works for Katniss because it is <i>safe</i> for her. <br /><br />(What I\u2019m saying is this was tenderness.)<br /><br />I more think this series is interesting in how it talks about the nature of power and <b>the nature of uprising.</b> The uprising, as a whole, is an upswelling of the people, a realization that there is strength in numbers. Yet some of the most revolutionary actions of this series are individual \u2014 it takes Katniss\u2019 desire to save her sister to start a war, Katniss\u2019 love for little Rue to create horror, Cinna\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his life to create a symbol. Even during war, the individual lives of characters like Joanna and Haymitch and Finnick <i>matter</i>. They matter to the narrative, and thus they matter to us too. <br /><br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"ab8990a1-733a-4922-8476-5cdff5c4cf5c\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"ab8990a1-733a-4922-8476-5cdff5c4cf5c\">The ending of book three is essentially a moment in which Katniss realizes that in taking out an old source of power, a new dictator has sprung up in his place on the same level of authoritarianism. I\u2019m going to say it: the moment in which she chooses to shoot Coin is honest to god one of the best moments in literary history.</label><br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is still a deeply revolutionary heroine not only in that she\u2019s written to be fairly gender non-conforming but also in that she is outwardly cold to all but her very few favorite people, and the narrative does not see fit to <i>punish</i> her for it, but to empathize with her and allow her to grow naturally in small ways. Her journey is not in becoming a Nice Person but in self-actualization. That is not a journey female characters are ever ever ever allowed to take and is arguably still something new. <br /><br />I almost want to case study this. It\u2019s a similar dynamic to Lord of the Rings being blamed for the general problems of late-1900s fantasy... but worse, because criticism of the YA dystopian genre so often fell into somewhat misogynistic areas, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point in denying that <i>The Hunger Games</i>, due to having an image as Something Young Women Enjoyed\u2122\ufe0f, received far more criticism than its equivalents in other genres. <br /><br />It's crazy that the first big ya dystopia is the best ya dystopia and one of the best series of all time, but this one is truly a classic and remains so incredible. Thank you to Katniss Everdeen for being one of the most interesting characters ever written and to this book for having such a dynamic story. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://thebookishactress.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Blog</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jespergayhey\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thebookishactress/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://sptfy.com/4F6I\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Spotify</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/thebookishactress\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Youtube</a> | <a href=\"https://thebookishactress.carrd.co/#about\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">About</a> | <br /><br /><br />\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br /><b>\ud83d\udd0dTOP THREE REASONS TO READ THG</b><br /><br />1. <b>It's relevant to our world.</b> The parallels to our own society are so amazingly drawn, and the worldbuilding so good, that I'm not surprised this book was the one that broke through. <br />2. <b>Dramatic tension.</b> Tell me you weren't on the edge of your seat every moment of this book.

I fell asleep and had horrible dream (credit to graphic violence). Next morning I finished it owning to its fast pace.<br /><u>\n  <b>This book is special:</b>\n</u><br />This is <b>my first dystopian novel</b>. I was very much excited about it since it was my introduction to a new genre. I would like to thank this book for such amazing description of dystopian world.<br /><br /><u>\n  <b>The book:</b>\n</u><br />This is a kind of book which probably everyone has read including their dogs, cats and birds too!<br />So there is no need to hide the spoilers but as warning-<br /><b>**SPOILERS AHEAD**</b><br />This book started brilliantly and within few pages sucked me into it. The <b>world building part is brilliant</b>. Introduction to districts, new society, people\u2019s life, the rules, the reaping, and yes \u2018The hunger Games\u2019. It is fast paced with simplistic writing. These are all good things. The best part kids are starting to read the books.<br />But that\u2019s where the good things end.<br />Suzanne Collins created the opportunity (golden ones) and one by one she destroyed it. But still most of the people are enthralled by the book as it eventually came out. But I\u2019m not.<br />So I\u2019m going to tell very explicitly what I didn\u2019t like...<br /><br /><u>\n  <b>Using the first person perspective and thus losing the chance to give depth to any character</b>\n</u><br />This story has been told through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, she just doesn't give a damn about anyone else except her family so naturally the other characters are too shallow and one dimensional.<br />Many people just love Peeta and Katniss but I don\u2019t like either of them. <b>All I knew about Peeta</b> was that he liked Katniss from age of five, saved her twice and is now in love with Katniss, rest is mystery.<br /><b>About Katniss</b>, she does a lot of thing (infact she does everything in the book) but never has a second thought about them, never reflect over what she has done, eventually no attachment with the character.<br /><b>People tend to like Rue, Peeta, Cinna</b> because these are few characters that spent time with Katniss, but (again)no character has depth.<br />One more outcome that I feel from other reviews is that Katniss is definitely heroine of the story but why make other 10 kids villain. While Cato and Clove make their kill they become monster but when Katniss makes her kill, it has to be justified as revenge for killing Rue and pity killing of Cato.<br />This book is all about <b>KATNISS, KATNISS and KATNISS</b>...<br /><br /><u>\n  <b>Very predictable plot</b>\n</u><br />The plot is so much predictable that I was surprised after every 10 or 20 pages (I\u2019m not out of my mind) because the story would turn out exactly how I would guess. First I thought that maybe my mind is highly synchronised with Collins\u2019s mind but later on reading other reviews it turned out the plot was predictable.<br /><br /><u>\n  <b>Missed opportunities</b>\n</u><br />This could have been much more interesting novel. Where did it all go wrong? As I\u2019m writing, everything wrong in story to me looks like is outcome of first person perspective.<br />--I would have felt much more connected to the games had it contained a bit of background information of every important tributes. Despite the killings being graphical, I didn\u2019t felt sad for their deaths.<br />--<b>When Katniss makes her first kill</b>, she moves over to do other things (because Rue is dying). But later when she realises that it was her first kill, still she doesn\u2019t reflect over it even for a minute. Killing other human has effect on the killer, until and unless killer is sociopath, moreover here the killers are kids. Instead of giving insight to their mind the story flatly moves ahead with killing and ending the games.<br /><br /><u>\n  <b>It doesn\u2019t make me think</b>\n</u><br />I read books because I enjoy it and because they push my mind to a new level of thinking which benefit me. This book made me think only about, why I didn\u2019t like this book when whole world is enjoying this. No further thoughts beyond that.<br /><br />Maciek\u2019s thought on this book:<br /><blockquote>\n  <b>\u201cThe Hunger Games reads like a bag of chips, meaning you can devour it in several short bites but it will leave you unnourished and aside from gas, it won\u2019t have much effect.\u201d</b>\n</blockquote><br />FOR ALL THIS <b>2 STARS(**)</b><br />In many reviews people come out with most lame excuse (defense) I have ever heard- <b>IT\u2019s A YOUNG-ADULT NOVEL</b><br />As for other books in the series, I will definitely read them but I\u2019m not in hurry or excited with this prospect. I will read it someday, probably before second installment of the movie.<br /><br /><b>To put a perfect end to \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 week</b><br /><b>28th march</b>- I watched the movie<br /><b>Movie</b> turned out pretty good, much better than I had anticipated. As I watched the movie it seemed that novel was written with movie in mind. Few minor changes, like in the end President Snow shown thinking representing its start of story unlike novel which ends. Some scenes are breath taking, too much violence. Acting by Jennifer Lawrence is good (she turned out better than Katniss in the book). I liked the movie, rated it 7/10.<br /><br />This review is inspired by <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/212024120\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Maciek\u2019s review</a> and <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/301609727\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Brian\u2019s review</a>.<br /><b>P.S.

This is not necessarily a lottery you would want to win, as the Hunger Games contest is a gladiatorial battle to the death.

But I had a niggling concern early on. When I began reading, I wondered if there might be a political agenda at play. The \u201cCapitol\u201d is clearly the evil tyrant here, with the oppressed working people living in dread of their overlords. Had this story been published in the early-to-mid 20th century, one might presume that the \u201cCapitol\u201d stood in for the fascism of Germany, Italy or Spain, or the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union/Russia or China. However, given the political climate of the twenty-teens, in which cynical forces of the right seek at every opportunity to portray government of any sort as the personification of evil, one must wonder if the author subscribed to the notion. I confess to not having read her prior work, so lack a basis there, and the interviews with Collins I read offer no insight. So, I am not saying that this is so, just that the portrayal made me wonder. I will read more of Collins\u2019 work and look into the subject some more outside pages she wrote, and if I find anything definitive I will update this entry.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1613707844i/30891681._SX540_.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"xxx\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><i>Jennifer Lawrence with Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne</i> - image from RogerEbert.com<br><br>PS - Subsequent to writing the above, I read the following two <i>Hunger Games</i> books.

Unless you are an author of equal worth to the one whose work you review, what powers of prose and observation are you likely to have to fitly adorn the work? <br /><br />'The Hobbit' is at one level simply a charming adventure story, perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told. There, see how simple that was? If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable. At some level, there is little more to say. Enjoy the story as the simple entertainment it was meant to be. Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces. That's enough.<br /><br />But if it was only simple entertainment, I do not think that it would be anything more than just a good book. Instead, this simple children's story resonates and fascinates. It teases and hints at something larger and grander, and it instructs and lectures as from one of the most subtle intellects without ever feeling like it is instructing, lecturing or being condescending.<br /><br />At its heart, the complaint I opened the review with is just a variation on one of the many nuanced observations Tolkien makes in 'The Hobbit' when he complains that a story of a good time is always too quickly told, but a story of evil times often requires a great many words to cover the events thereof. How often has that idea fascinated me.<br /><br />Consider also how the story opens, with Bilbo's breezy unreflective manners which are polite in form but not in spirit, and Gandalf's continual meditation on the meaning of 'Good morning.\u2019 How much insight is concealed within Gandalf's gentle humor! How often do we find ourselves, like Bilbo, saying something we don't really mean and using words to mean something very unlike their plain meaning! How often do we find ourselves saying, \"I don't mean to be rude, but...\", when in fact we mean, \"I very much mean to be rude, and here it comes!\" If we did not mean to be rude, surely we wouldn't say what we say. Instead we mean, \"I'm going to be rude but I don't want you to think I'm someone who is normally rude...\", or \"I'm going to put myself forward, but I don't want you to think of me as someone who is normally so arrogant...\", or even, \"I'm going to be rude, but I don't want to think of myself as someone who is rude, so I'm going to pretend I'm not being rude...\"<br /><br />I think that is what makes this more than just a good book, but a great one. Tolkien is able to gently skewer us for our all too human failings, and he does so without adopting any of the cynicism or self-loathing so common with those that seek out to skewer humanity for its so evident failings. <br /><br />We fantasize about heroes which are strong and comely of form, and we have for as long as we've had recorded literature. Our comic books are filled with those neo-pagan mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues always amount to, whatever else may be true of them, 'beats people up good'. These modern Ajaxs, Helens and Achilles dominate the box office, and I would imagine dominate our internal most private fantasy lives as well. Oh sure, the superhero of our fantasy might have superhuman ethics to go along with his superhuman ability to kick butt, attract the opposite sex, and enforce their will upon others, but it is always attached to and ultimately secondary to our fantasy of power and virility. How different is Tolkien's protagonist from Heracles, Lancelot, Beowulf, or Batman - short, small, mundane, and weak. Of all the principal characters of the story, he possesses probably the least of that quintessential heroic attribute - martial prowess.<br /><br />And yet, he is not actually merely an 'average Joe'. Bilbo is just as much an exaggerated idealized hero as Heracles, it's just that those attributes in which Bilbo is almost transcendently inhuman isn't the sort of attributes we normally fantasize about having ourselves. Bilbo is gentle. He is simple. He is humble. Power and wealth have little attraction for him. He is kind. He takes less than his share, and that that he takes he gives away. He is a peacemaker. Though wrongly imprisoned, he bears no grudge and desires no vengeance for the wrongs done to him. Rather he apologizes for stealing food, and offers to repay in recompense far more than he took. Though mistreated, he harbors no enmity. He never puts himself forward, but he never shirks when others do. <br /><br />How often do we fantasize about being this different sort of hero, and yet how much better we would be if we did? How much better off would we be if we, like Thorin could declare in our hearts, \"There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\" How often is it that we hunger after all the wrong things? What profit would we really have if we had in great measure the power to 'beat people up good'? What real use could we put it too? How much better off would we be individually and as a people if we most desired to be graced with Bilbo's virtues, rather than Achilles speed, strength, and skill with arms? How much less mature does this mere children's book of a well lit-world cause our darker fantasies to seem?<br /><br />Now, I admit I am biased in my review. I read this book 36 times before the age of 16. I broke the spines of three copies of it with continual reading. Yet in my defense I will say that I'm considered only a moderate fan of the book by many. I've known several devotees of the book who, like the protagonist of Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451', can recite whole chapters from memory - ensuring that this would be one of the few books that would survive the sudden destruction of all the world's technology if only the world's story tellers survived. If you are inclined to think no book can be that good, and that my review overhypes it, so much the better. Go in with low expectations so as to be certain that they will be met or exceeded. Forget all I have said save that, \"If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable.\"<br />",

    "text": "<blockquote>\n  <b>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.</b>\n</blockquote>Books exist in time and place and our experience of them is affected by the specific time and place in which we encounter them. Sometimes an uplifting or inspiring book can change the path of a life that has wandered onto a wrong course. Sometimes a book, discovered early on, can form part of the foundation of who we are. Or, discovered late, can offer insight into the journey we have taken to date. Sometimes a book is just a book. But not <i>The Hobbit</i>. Not for me. In January, 2013, I pulled out my forty-year old copy in anticipation of seeing the recently released Peter Jackson film. It is a substantial book, heavy, not only with its inherent mass, but for the weight of associations, the sediment of time. The book itself is a special hard-cover edition published in 1973, leather bound, in a slipcase, the booty of new love from that era. The book, while victim to some internal binding cracks (aren't we all?) is still in decent shape, unlike that long-vanquished relationship. Not surprising. I had read the story six times and been there and back again with this particular volume five. <br><br> <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1544159384i/26706175._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"xxx\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><b>J.R.R. Tolkien</b> - image from Vision.org<br><br><i>The Hobbit</i> had first come to my attention in 1965 or '66. I was then a high school underclassman, and my eyes were drawn to it at a school book fair. That was probably the ideal age, for me anyway, to gain an introduction to Tolkien. Not too far along into adolescence and an appreciation of the reality of the world to have completely tarnished my capacity for child-like wonder. That is what one must bring to a reading of this book, openness and innocence. Tolkien was a step sidewise for me, as I was a fan of the science fiction of that and prior eras. It was also, of course, a gateway drug for the grander addiction of LOTR, still my favorite read of all time. <br><br>One might think that looking at this book again with <s>old, weary</s> fresh eyes might lend new insight. After all, I have read literally thousands of books since, and have picked up at least a little critical capacity. And yes, there are things I notice now that perhaps skipped past back then. Of course that begs a specification of which <i>back then</i> one considers. While I first read the book as a high-schooler, I read it again when I was gifted with this beautiful volume, in my twenties. That makes two readings. But there would be more. I well recall reading the book aloud while sitting in a chair by my son's bed. And yes, each of the major characters was delivered with a distinct voice. I went as deep as I could for Gandalf. I vaguely recall giving the dwarves a Scottish burr. Bilbo was definitely a tenor. My Gollum was remarkably like the sound of the one created by Andy Serkisssssss. (patting self on back). <br><br>Of course, my son was not the last to arrive at the gathering. Some years later there was a daughter, and more bedside theater. It was a bit more of a struggle then. Life was rather hectic. Nerves were often frayed. Sleep was in short supply. And there were far too many times when my eyes closed before those of my little gingersnap. But reading it that fourth time, one couldn't help but notice the absence of any significant females. Who might my little girl relate to here? It is certainly possible for folks to identify with characters of another gender, but the stark absence of representatives of the female persuasion did stand out. Somehow I managed to keep my eyes open long enough to get through the volume.<br><br>But the party was not yet complete. There would be one more arrival, and one more opportunity to sit on or near a daughter's bed and read aloud, sometimes to an upturned, eager face, sometimes to a riot of ringlets as she settled. My capacity for consciousness remained an issue. By then, my voice had also suffered a bit with the years, the reward for too many cigarettes, too much yelling, too much ballpark whistling, and the usual demise of age, so it took a fair bit more effort and strain than reading it aloud had done previously. I am pretty certain I made it through that third time aloud. Truthfully, I am not 100% certain that I did.<br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380318646i/689619._SY540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><br>You probably know the story, or the broad strokes anyway. In the quiet rural village of Hobbiton Across the Water, in a land called Middle Earth, an unpresupposing everyman, Bilbo Baggins, lives a quiet existence. He has a smidgen of wanderlust in him, the genetic gift of ancestors on the Took branch of his family tree, but he is mostly content to enjoy hearty meals and a good pipe. One day, Gandalf, a lordly, father-figure wizard Bilbo has known for many years, comes a-calling and Bilbo's life is upended. Gandalf is helping a group of dwarves who are on a quest. Led by Thorin Oakenshield, a dwarf king, they aim to return to their home, inside the Lonely Mountain, somehow rid the place of Smaug, the dragon who has taken up residence, and regain the land and incredible treasure that is rightfully theirs. Gandalf has recommended that Bilbo accompany the group, as a burglar. Bilbo, of course, has never burgled a thing in his life, and is horrified by the prospect. But, heeding his Tookish side, Bilbo joins the dwarves and the adventure is on. <br><br>One need not go far to see this as a journey of self-discovery, as Bilbo finds that there is more to him than even he realized. This raises one question for me. How did Gandalf know that Bilbo would be the right hobbit for the job? Bilbo faces many challenges and I betray no secrets for any who have not just arrived on this planet by reporting that Bilbo's dragons, real and symbolic, are ultimately slain and he returns home a new, and somewhat notorious hobbit. Bilbo serves well as the everyman, someone who is quite modest about his capacities, but who rises to meet the challenges that present, acting in spite of his fear and not in the absence of it. He is someone we can easily care and root for. <br><br>Elements abound of youthful adventure yarns, treasure, a map to the treasure, a secret entrance that requires solving a riddle to gain entry, a spooky forest, foolishness and greed among those in charge, a huge battle, and, ultimately, good sense triumphing over evil and stupidity. Oh, yeah, there is something in there as well about a secret, powerful ring that can make it\u2019s wearer invisible. Sorry, no damsels in distress.<br><br>(Rivendell remains a pretty special place. If I am ever fortunate enough to be able to retire, I think I would like to spend my final days there, whether the vision seen by Tolkien or the Maxfield Parrish take as seen in the LOTR films.)<br> <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380318646i/689620._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>There are magical beings aplenty here. Hobbits, of course, and the wizard and dwarves we meet immediately. A shape shifting Beorn assists the party but remains quite frightening. There are trolls, giant spiders, giants, goblins, were-wolf sorts called wargs, talking eagles, a communicative, if murderous dragon, elves of both the helpful and difficult sorts, and a few men, as well. Then there is Gollum.<br><br>IMHO, Bilbo is not the most interesting character in Tolkien's world. Arguably there is a lot more going on with Gollum, an erstwhile hobbit riven by the internal conflict of love and hate, corrupted, but not without a salvageable soul. While he is given considerably more ink in the LOTR story, it is in <i>The Hobbit</i> that we meet him for the first time. He is the single least YA element in this classic yarn, one of the things that elevates this book from the field and makes it a classic. <br><br><i>The Hobbit</i> was written before Tolkien's ambitious Lord of the Rings. While there are many references to classic lore, the bottom line is that this is a YA book. It is easy to read, and to read aloud, (something that is not the case with LOTR. I know.) and is clearly intended for readers far younger than I am today. It remains a fun read, even on the sixth (or so, I may have dipped in again somewhere along the line) time through. Were I reading it today for the first time, I would probably give it four stars. But as it bears the weighty treasure of memory and fond association, I must keep it at five. If you are reading this for the first time as an adult, or an antique, the impact is likely to be different for you. If you are a younger sort, of the adolescent or pre-adolescent persuasion, particularly if you are a boy, it might become an invaluable part of your life. Maybe one day you can sit by your child's or grandchild's bedside and be the person who reads these words to them for the first time, \"<i>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit</i>\" and begin the adventure again. To see the glowing young eyes as the tale unfolds is nothing less than absolutely precious.<br><br>PS \u2013 I would check out the <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/248910601\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">review</a> offered by GR pal Ted.

    "text": "What makes The Hobbit such a seminal work in the fantasy genre? Is it the nine hours of over-budget, sensorially explosive movies by Peter Jackson? Nope. Is it a complex tale of multiple human kingdoms slaughtering each other for an Iron Throne with buckets of blood and guts and plenty of sex? Nope. Is it simply wonderful writing. As simple and boring as that. Does that mean that I was incredibly disappointed in the movie adaptation (not to say abortion)? Yep. Does that mean I don't love Game of Thrones (books and TV shows)? No, they are great too. But the seminal work, the Divine Comedy that created the language and inspiration for George R.R. Martin as Dante created Italian from the common vernacular in Florence and Ravenna, was The Hobbit. The book, even for a slow reader is most likely able to be finished in 1/3 the time that Peter Jackson spent telling the story in 70mm film. Unlike Peter Jackson's version, there are no orcs and the element of danger is more psychological than psychical: Bilbo Baggins is battling his fears and his provincialism and growing up. The Hobbit should be read as the Odyssey of Middle Earth - a voyage of self-learning and maturation that is more about the monsters in Bilbo's imagination than those encountered in his baptismal voyage into the unknown with Gandalf. Gandalf. Honestly, would there EVER have been a Dumbledore had there not been a Gandalf? Did any Tolkien reader NOT picture Gandalf when Rowlings talked about Dumbledorf in the first Harry Potter book?<br /><br />Bilbo does encounter some monsters and even outsmarts Smaug the Dragon (wow, I mean what a perfect name for a dragon! More evocative than Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion in my opinion - and again would they even have existed had Smaug not preceded them?) and he saves Middle Earth before returning to the Shire. He is not the same person he was before leaving. He is Ulysses without a Penelope waiting for him (unless his pipe is secretly called Penelope in his expanded imagination or his Penelope is a symbol of his vast library in Rivendell). <br /><br />In literature, there is nothing quite like the Hobbit in its simplicity and beauty and its symbolic voyage: we are of course introduced to the elves, the humans, the dwarves...but they are all on the outskirts of the story. The Hobbit is about one small hobbit fighting his greatest fears...and winning.<br /><br /><b>Fino's Tolkien Reviews:</b><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1770368163?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Hobbit</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1700149425?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Fellowship of the Ring (LOTR 1)</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1772170129?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Two Towers (LOTR 2)</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1772170309\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Return of the King (LOTR 3)</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1947038308?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Lord of the Rings 1-3 - General Comments and Observations</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3063074284?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Raymond Edward's Tolkien biography</a><br />",

Lewis's impact on Tolkien, there may have been no LOTR. Just imagine how empty the nowadays fantasy world could look like. But at least it\u00b4s not <br /> <br />As complex as the Silmarillion<br /><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7332.The_Silmarillion\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7...</a><br />Holy heck, this thing was a mind blowing, complex, interwoven, totally over my little nerd brain behemoth of a book, truly hardcore stuff if you\u00b4re into that. Some purists may argue that the hobbit is too simplified, but again, it\u00b4s a freaking book for kids. I just don\u00b4t get the people ordering pizza at the golden arches drive in and then complaining and wanting to talk to the manager. Reading Karens are just ridiculous. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(slang)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(...</a><br /> <br />Would be a bit over the top to see a deeper allegory regarding greed and power in Smaug<br />But it\u00b4s always a nice move to show kids the problems with endless exponential shiny growth until there is no gold left anymore. There definitively is an equivalent of this concept in the pure, endless exponential evil growth concept in LOTR and one could take another, controversial step and ask who Morgoth (the Prime minister or CEO?) Sauron (an important minister or CDO), and Saruman (an overachieving higher bureaucrat or rayon manager) could be in 21st century real life. I\u00b4m not just joking, I\u00b4m really often thinking<br /> <br />About the manifestations of evil in different genres and reality<br />See how hidden it is in this short piece, opening the just potential for many kids to later ask what it could have meant. And for everyone else to look at her/his society and point at the darkest, crudest unfolding potential. In the worst case, this is not just political terror mixed with theocracy witch burning, but garnished with a stupid, self destructive economic system ruining everything. At least privileged Western people like me just have the ethical problem of choosing the favored luxury consumer goods from the top of piles of corpses and natural destruction caused in some place nobody knows. I just don\u00b4t know which 8K 65 inch TV I should buy and if I should spend my vacation in the mountains or by the sea. However,<br /> <br />Why should anyone handle Tolkien the Nobel prize for literature? <br />Just because he founded one of the greatest literary genres ever? So better give it to another sophisticated intellectual who probably ( I haven\u00b4t read any Ivo Andric <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2147.Ivo_Andri_?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true\">https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...</a> ) is so over the top work to read that it\u00b4s just exhausting. But I\u00b4m biased regarding Nobel Price and snobby classic literature, so I\u00b4ll better stop complaining about things I\u00b4m too lazy to read and that just aren\u00b4t fun, but even often pretty downers too. But it\u00b4s still funny that nobody reads all this Nobel Price stuff, fantasy and sci fi never were allowed to enter, and still became the most inspiring literature to rule them all. <br /><br />Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: <br /><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit\">https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...</a>",

    "text": "<b> Andy Serkis is doing a live reading of this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QOF_r_Y5-A\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">RIGHT NOW</a> for charity!</b> <br><br>To call this the epitome in which all high fantasy should be judged does not quite suffice; this is simply one of the best books that has ever been written or will ever be written. <i>The Hobbit</i> defines the high fantasy genre along with its sequel, of course, and has been an inspiration to countless authors and readers alike. Tolkien, quite literally, kick started a genre that would eventually capture the hearts of thousands of people. He changed the literary world. He made fantasy real. <br><br><b>The best fantasy universe ever created</b><br><br> <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/photos/1435781412p8/1203788.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Middle Earth is undoubtedly the best fantasy universe created. It is the most original and richly devised. It is very hard for fantasy authors not to borrow elements from Tolkien. He set the definition with his wonderful world. Tolkien\u2019s references to modern day are also very amusing and almost unnoticeable in the brilliant narrative, but a perceptive reader will notice the whimsical contrasts he has drawn between his world and the real world. The sheer depth of Tolkien\u2019s imagination is really unmeasurable. I wonder what other ideas for books he may have had that he never got to write. <br><br><i>\u201cThe road goes ever on and on\u201d</i><br><br>Bilbo, like the reader, is blown away by the breath-taking landscape of Middle Earth. We must remember that he too is experiencing the majesty of Rivendell and the mightiness of Erabor for the first time. His reaction reflects a reader who is also awestruck by a world that is as beautifully magical as it is corrupt and wicked; it is a world in which both the benevolent and the malignant reside; it is a world whose people are capable of both great kindness and equally as great cruelty. The peoples are diverse and contrasting; I think the differences between the elves and the dwarves are best captured in their music. The music of the elves is full of mirth and is generally quite playful whereas the music of the dwarves is strong, deep and full of resolve to match their stubborn nature. <br><br><b>The wonderful, wonderful, story</b><br><br> <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/photos/1435781350p8/1203785.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"316\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>This story belongs to Bilbo Baggins. This is something I think Peter Jackson would do well to remember, but that\u2019s beside the point. The tale begins as Bilbo accidently, unexpectedly, invites Gandalf for tea the next day after a brief encounter. The Wizard marks him as the fourteenth member of his company, his burglar. Bilbo doesn\u2019t really understand what he is getting himself in for when he agrees to join their mission. Indeed, the next evening thirteen dwarves, headed by Thorin Oakenshield, arrive along with their quest to reclaim their gold and slay a dragon: Smaug. Smaug has stolen their home fortress of Erebor. They want it back. Bilbo reluctantly gets dragged along though this reluctance is quickly overcome by a strong, secret, desire for adventure. <br><br><i>\u201cI am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone.' <br>I should think so \u2014 in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\u201d</i><br><br>The story becomes darker as they close in on the mountain. The company are attacked by spiders and abducted by the wood elves who want a share of the dwarfish treasure. The dwarves begin to rely on their burglar who they believed would become a liability. How wrong they were. Bilbo was destined to come along. They would have surely failed if he had not, and the ring of power may never have been destroyed. But, that\u2019s another wonderful story. The game of riddles and the finding of the ring is one of the more memorable scenes of the book and is Bilbo\u2019s gateway into heroism. I think the power he receives from the ring helps him to discover that not only does he have courage and fortitude, but he has lots of it. Gandalf, if anything, is an excellent judge of character. <br><br><b>The ending is just the beginning </b><br><br> <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/photos/1435781372p8/1203786.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>The ending of this book is undeniably rushed. Bilbo is unconscious for most of it, and we receive a post battle update. There are off page deaths and victories. In this, I think Tolkien cements the message of the story; it is not about the tragic death of a dwarf who went slightly mad, and then redeemed himself; it is not about a boatman who slayed a dragon, and became a renowned hero: it is about a Hobbit. This is Bilbo\u2019s story and no other's. It is a story in which a Hobbit who had no courage and no bravery found it. It is a story about a hobbit who was too scared to leave his house without a hanky eventually evolved into a Hobbit that would trick a dragon.<br><br><i>\u201cYou have nice manners for a thief and a liar,\" said the dragon.\u201d</i><br><br><b>Five stars.

As a teen, the book made me want to become a writer of fantastical tales...or go shoeless, live in a hole and smoke a pipe. As an adult, Tolkien's novel maintains within me a link to my childhood, safekeeping cherished memories and evoking everlasting emotions. <br><br>The troubles with trolls, those slinking spiders, the finding of treasure, cave exploration, riddles in the dark...it all added up in me a love for adventure. I would make many an ornate wooden sword in my father's basement workshop, because of Sting. Funny I didn't take to wearing rings though...<br><br>Being pint-sized, Mr. Baggins makes the perfect magnetic character for a young person. He is about a child's size, yet he is mature. Similar, yet something to aspire to. His diminutive stature made his implausible escapes and victories that much more satisfying. Nothing bores me more than muscle-bound killing machines wielding swords the size of windmill blades. <br><br>I have read this fantastic tale a number of times, watched the 70s cartoon movie version countless times and was counting down the days with unabashed eagerness until Peter Jackson's new live action film came out.

I try to refrain, but when John Huston bellows out, \"I am Gandalf and Gandalf means ME!!!\"...well, I just can't help myself. Crazy-off-his-rocker Brother Theodore as Gollum still astounds me with the sheer depth of his guttural growl. Sorry voice-straining Serkis, but this is the real Gollum, the creepy muthah that kept me up nights. Though Rankin &amp; Bass's version skips over the whole Beorn scene entirely, coming in at 90 minutes, they actually managed to pack in quite a bit of story. Certainly it is truncated (to absurdity during The Battle of Five Armies), but at least it's not overblown, as appears to be happening with Peter Jackson's unnecessarily long trilogy of this single book. <br><br><i>The Hobbit, or There And Back Again (An illustrated book by Rankin &amp; Bass)</i><br>Though it's a few pages shorter than the regular paperback version, this marvelous part-text, part-illustrated version seems to be unabridged. It includes screenshots taken directly from the 70s cartoon, plus where the movie skipped over parts of the book they've included extra illustrations, admittedly of mixed quality.

Peter Jackson was given too long a leash when New Line stretched this one book out to three separate movies. Instead of one movie packed with awesome, we get three that, so far (I've yet to see the third and I'm not eager to), have been watered down and dragged out. Extra scenes are added and add nothing: Really, a sleigh ride chase scene with an incredibly minor character? And honestly, can Richard Armitage (as Thorin Oakenshield) act with any other part of his body besides his eyebrows?",

Tolkien\u2019s love letter to fantasy literature.<br><br>A reader to this timeless classic will first notice that this is a first person narration, the reader hears Tolkien\u2019s voice as he narrates the tale of Bilbo Baggins, Belladonna Took\u2019s odd son who, though he resembles his respectable and comfortable father, has an unexpected adventure in him. J.R.R. Tolkien is telling us a story, with an occasional soliloquy and off stage remark to us the reader.<br><br>This of course is the charming and entertaining prequel to Tolkien\u2019s monumental fantasy trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, but a fine tale in its own right and by itself. Generations of readers and dreamers have loved this story for its whimsical allure and for its role as a stage setter for its more epic later cousins.<br><br>The Films. Readers nowadays have the good fortune of being audience to Sir Peter Jackson\u2019s magnificent films, but I and many folks of an earlier generation better recall the 1977 Bass and Rankin animated film with voice talent from John Huston, Orson Bean and Richard Boone. This cartoon was my first introduction to Tolkien\u2019s work and would inspire me to actually read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings later.<br><br>Thorin, the important Dwarf and company leave from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheGreenDragonPublicHouse?fref=ts\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Green Dragon</a> in May, accompanied by the wizard Gandalf and having employed Mr. Baggins as their lucky number (14) and as a burglar. And Bilbo\u2019s unexpected adventure had begun.<br><br>\u201cI am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me!\u201d \u2013 The significance of Gandalf in fantasy literature cannot be overestimated. Certainly there had been wizards, magicians and sages in literature before 1937, but Gandalf in many respects is THE wizard. As fine a performance as Sir Ian McKellen did in all his films portraying Gandalf, I still, in my mind, hear John Huston\u2019s husky yet urbane voice speaking for him. Later readers of the Lord of the Rings and <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/7332.The_Silmarillion\" title=\"The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien\" rel=\"noopener\">The Silmarillion</a> will learn more about the Gray Wanderer, but in the Hobbit he is simply Gandalf.<br><br>Chapter 5 \u2013 Riddles in the Dark. After some fairly pedestrian undertakings Tolkien has Bilbo getting lost in a deep cave and introduces us to one of his and literatures greastest, most complicated, and strangely likeable villains, Gollum. Later readers would learn the deeper truths of his history, but Tolkien\u2019s guests in this chapter see him as a eccentrically troubled scoundrel.<br><br>Songs. A reader in the twenty-first century, and especially one who has enjoyed the Jackson films, may be surprised to discover that Tolkien\u2019s original story was not as martial as the films. Certainly Jackson produced his Hobbit films to be less war-like than his epic LOTR films, but Tolkien\u2019s prose contained a fair amount of poetry and song, casting his story in a more innocent and lyric form than would be palatable in today\u2019s publications.<br><br>I remember trying to convince my high school English teacher that this was deserving of more literary praise and so this was also my first or one of my first indications that many literary folks place an asterisk on the science fiction / fantasy genre when it comes to acknowledging the quality of the writing. Kurt Vonnegut mentioned that as soon as the science fiction label was affixed to his name many critics would not take him seriously. <br><br>The Hobbit is a great example that sometimes critics can be myopic and time will tell the true greats. The prologue to a great trilogy, simple and charming, The Hobbit is a great book by itself.<br><br>Finally, this review is of a re-visit to The Hobbit, after a hiatus of perhaps 30 years. I rarely will re-read a book, there are just so many great books and so little time \u2013 but The Hobbit is one of those special works that can be savored and enjoyed again and again.<br><br>*** 2020 Reread. <br>I need to reread this more often. Professor Tolkien\u2019s charming storytelling is a soothing comfort for troubled times.<br><br>This time around I focused on the details that I had missed before, and Tolkien has provided many, some nuanced within his excellent story and other subtle enough to be missed, but important spice added to the recipe.<br><br>It\u2019s also important to distinguish between the book and the excellent adaptions by Peter Jackson and the 1977 animated classic by Bass and Rankin. In my memory, I sometimes forget what is actual canon and not artistic license. I had forgotten that the Master of Laketown (left out of the 1977 film) was from Tolkien.<br><br>Tolkien\u2019s description of the journey is also endearing, taking the time to add his nineteenth century sensibilities to the fantasy.<br><br>If you have never read this work, please do. I can highly recommend an enjoyable reread to the rest of us.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1602270710i/30214798._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"213\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">",

The Hobbit (the version rewritten by Tolkien) is sophisticated enough to please adults and children alike.<br /><br />Initially, nobody knew how Gollum looked like. Seriously, just take a look at the various covers of the book and you'll see diverse bodies as Gollum. The Ring acquired by Bilbo is so quaint, so practical.<br /><br />Tolkien weaved his magic here and delivered a timeless classic. The adventures of Bilbo, especially those without Gandalf to bail him out, are very original. I hope the uninitiated don't get deterred by the movie trilogy. That would be a tragedy. I give this book a perfect five stars.",

    "text": "Not much more needs to be said about The Hobbit than that it is excellent! Great storytelling, fun characters, humor, action \u2013 it has it all. Tolkien is rightfully one of the (if not THE) founding fathers of modern Fantasy. If you are already into the Fantasy genre and you haven\u2019t read him, you need to. If you are looking to get into Fantasy, The Hobbit is a great place to start.<br /><br />One of the great things about The Hobbit is that I think it is easily accessible to a wide audience. The Lord of the Rings is a much larger and more daunting commitment which might be too much for the casual Fantasy fan. Then, if you are really into lore and world building, I hear people talk about The Silmarillion as a great but very dense history of Middle Earth. So, Tolkien has it all: Fantasy-101 or master\u2019s thesis level Fantasy \u2013 you can decide how you want to approach his works.<br /><br />One thing that has been bugging me about other Fantasy novels I have been reading lately is that there is a lot of wandering around without much action or story progress. And, this wandering around can stretch for several books. With The Hobbit, there is adventure, and \u201cwandering\u201d, but it moves quickly and gets to the point. Large chunks of progress are made without pages and pages of rambling dialogue. I appreciate how well The Hobbit gets to the point but does not leave you feeling cheated by it going too fast.<br /><br />Another thing that I love about this Fantasy book is that it does not bog down with complicated names, location terminology, odd magic systems, etc. This is another thing that has been turning me off to other Fantasy lately because I cannot just escape and enjoy the book. Instead, I have to keep a notebook and a flowchart to keep everything straight! With The Hobbit, it was very organic and easy to follow \u2013 perfect for a relaxing Fantasy getaway for the brain.<br /><br />I did not yet see the recent movies they made from this book but was surprised at first that they made it into three movies. After rereading this, I think I can see how they could expand on certain parts to make a movie trilogy. I will have to go and check it out now.<br /><br />The Hobbit \u2013 read it!<br />",

    "text": "Now the route Mr. Bilbo Baggins transverses to seek adventure and a pot of gold...several in fact, may not be as glamorous as the yellow brick road nonetheless thoroughly lucrative...he will never complain....after he is safely back home.... As our story begins the Hobbit is having a quiet, delightful time drinking his tea and a nice breakfast, steps out the door (from his hole in the ground the unkind would say) blows a wonderful smoke ring...And is the last one for many moons... a peaceful situation I mean. An old man, a stranger appears the polite hobbit greets him, Bilbo later regrets it often but that's further down the road. The sociable Mr. Baggins invites the man who reveals himself to be the powerful, mystifying, lofty wizard Gandalf to tea...tomorrow. The nervous hobbit, half the size of a human just wants to be left alone and enjoy his comfortable life which unfortunately doesn't occur, on the other hand the reader is greatly rewarded. Next day a dwarf arrives Dwalin, than another Balin, and still more, two in fact, Kili and Fili, five then, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin, this will in a short while ( pun intended) be thirteen, no I haven't forgotten Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and last very appropriately , the leader Thorin, they are a superstitious bunch. The need for a fourteenth member is obvious ( you can't count a wizard) , these creatures are eating, drinking at poor Bilbo's home... an unexpected party is fully in bloom causing the owner a headache ...think of the expense and danger to his dishes and furniture. Finally Gandalf comes and the purpose of the gathering disclosed, a bold plan to kill a huge dragon Smaug the Magnificent, take the vast priceless treasure, the winged fire breathing behemoth sits on, inside the very distant Lonely Mountain, the dwarfs ancient home. The reluctant Mr. Baggins agrees to go along, not too confidently , he can see disaster in his future... Deadly monsters, goblins, wolves, unfriendly elves are between their goal, the sinister Misty Mountains, rivers to cross, lakes too, the dark thick forest Mirkwood, where evil giant spiders, sinister wizards, unfriendly wood-elves reside, with only a little stream to guide and follow , then Gandalf abandons them...Still the frightened little hobbit becomes the leader, with the help of a magical ring. The battle of five armies, a grisly fight where no quarter is given, an epic style end to this tale is the high point. This classic written in 1937 is the original, The Lord of the Rings are sequels and more magical than Mr. Bilbo Baggins band. If you wonder why someone would read a book for the third time all you need to do is get this title... (yes more than one novel in my library ) . A trip in a world where you can forget your troubles and drop into one let's face it, quite interesting ... an ominous place to become a hero even get rich if you serve well, and survive obstacles in the way that all good people will.",

As I said in <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/38902981\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">my review of The Lord of the Rings</a>, for me Tolkien is all about language. I must have read <i>The Hobbit</i> when I was about 8, and even at that age I was fascinated by his made-up names. They sort of made sense, but not quite.<br /><br />Then, when I was 21, I learned Swedish, and suddenly there were many things in Middle Earth that came into focus! Of course, the Wargs get their name from the Swedish <i>varg</i>, wolf. And \"Beorn\" is like <i>bj\u00f6rn</i>, bear.<br /><br />But I never figured out why Bilbo was teasing the spiders in Mirkwood by calling them \"attercop\". Now I know. It's an archaic English word related to the modern Norwegian word for spider, <i>edderkopp</i>. The Swedish word, <i>spindel</i>, comes from a different root. I've thought about that for over 40 years. See how much fun it is to acquire a new language?<br />__________________________________<br /><br />If you want to know what I think of Peter Jackson's three Hobbit movies, look <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1203327004\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/40567735\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1146669957\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a>.<br />",

We\u2019re introduced to younger wizard Gandalf, Frodo\u2019s uncle Bilbo Baggins who is a talented thief, already crossed his path with Gollum and his preciooouss ring! <br /><br /> A short, fascinating, riveting, magical story and introduction to the hobbit world which shouldn\u2019t be turned into a trilogy on big screen! ( Peter Jackson followed the same way as he did with Lord of the rings series but at least there were three books! In my opinion it was not necessary to watch more movies with so many elaborated scenes even though I enjoyed to hear velvet voice of Cumberbatch as the voice of Dragon Smaug. It was awkward reunion of Sherlock &amp;Watson) <br /><br /> So I\u2019d better reread this journey for celebrating 84th year of its publishing. <br /><br /> The story starts with Bilbo Baggins\u2019 finding himself host a tea party for a party of dwarves ( Gandalf is also a skillful trickster and it would be hard to say no to him. He\u2019s my favorite all time favorite fantasy character after Harry Potter\u2019s Dumbledore) Those dwarves song of reclaiming Lonely Mountain and its treasure from the dragon Smaug. As soon as the song ends Bilbo also finds himself accepting the offer becoming a part of their journey as a thief, and Gandalf maps out a secret door to Lonely Mountain which help them to reach their unique destination.<br /><br /> We follow their heart throbbing adventure from Shire to Misty Mountains,Mirkwood Forest, introduced to wood-elves till they reach to the Lost Kingdom which is located under Lonely Mountain where the dangerous Dragon Smaug resides. <br /><br />In my opinion this classic is my all time favorite reads which is better than its three movie long adaptations. <br /><br /> Here are my favorite quotes of this book:<br /><br />\u201cThere is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cMay the wind under your wings bear you when the sun sails and the moon walks.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWhere there's life there's hope.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIt cannot be seen, cannot be felt,<br />Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt,<br />It lies behind stars and under hills,<br />And empty holes it fills,<br />It comes first and follows after,<br />Ends life, kills laughter.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cThis is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected.\u201d",

For <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, I haven\u2019t been able to finish <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> because I loved the movies so much and I ended up finding the book incredibly boring; I will try again next year. As for <i>The Hobbit</i>, I was reluctant to read the book because I disliked the movie adaptation. After finally reading this for the first time, I can safely say that I still dislike the movies, and I felt more or less indifferent about the book.<br /><br />This will be a short review; I have nothing new to offer. <i>The Hobbit</i> is a book targeted for kids and, in my opinion, it certainly read like one. As I said, I most likely would\u2019ve enjoyed this book so much more if I were younger and weren\u2019t acquainted with other modern high-fantasy yet. Reading this for the first time, it felt like there was a complete lack of tension throughout the entire book. I also immensely disliked the storytelling voice implemented into the narration; it\u2019s so distracting to my immersion and rather than reading it felt to me like Tolkien was telling the story to me. I prefer seeing events unfolds from the character\u2019s perspective. That being said, I will also admit that I wasn\u2019t bored with it because the accessible prose made the book very easy to read.<br /><br /><i>The Hobbit</i> is a classic and I can totally understand why it became one. I will definitely consider reading this to my kids one day. I have no idea whether the decrease in enjoyment of the book was caused because of me watching the movies first or not, it might be. But overall, I just felt more or less indifferent about <i>The Hobbit</i>, which I guess is arguably even worse than disliking it. Honestly speaking, around 30% through the book, I ended up reading through it just for the sake of completing my bingo challenge rather than because I was having a good time with it. Thankfully, this was a short read.<br /><br /><b>You can order the book from: <u><a href=\"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780007118359/?a_aid=petrikleo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Book Depository (Free shipping)</a></u></b><br /><br /><i>You can find <b><u><a href=\"http://novelnotions.net/2019/07/19/book-review-the-hobbit-by-j-r-r-tolkien/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this</a></u></b> and the rest of my reviews at <b><u><a href=\"http://novelnotions.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Novel Notions</a></u></b></i>",

Now let's start LotR :)<br /><br />Buddy read with <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4919283-jennifer-jen\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Jen the unexpected party</a><br />Get it? the unexpected party, as in chapter one's title. Oh I'm hilarious.<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------<br />OK let\u2019s do this.<br />But first let\u2019s talk about something totally unrelated but totally is.<br /><br />So I don\u2019t know about you guys but when I watch a sporting event, no matter what it is, and I see these world class athletes doing their thing, all I think about is I couldn\u2019t possibly do this. That\u2019s why they are the ones doing it and I\u2019m the one watching it, but once in a while comes these, well there\u2019s only one word for it, Legends.<br /><br />These legends when predictable, still unstoppable, they do the hardest things the easiest way, they don\u2019t do things to show you they can, they do it so you know you can.<br />Mr. Tolkien is a legend, The Hobbit is a legend and Bilbo Baggins is a legend. <br /><br />There\u2019s so much I want to say but above and beyond all, If somehow you haven\u2019t read this book and you stumbled upon this review please do yourself a favor and go read it instead of this, because it\u2019ll be devastating to know that I cost you precious time you could and should spend reading The Hobbit.<br /><br />It\u2019s rare to read a fantasy novel and relate to its protagonist us much us I did.<br />Hero, or as I said legend are words associated in our minds with pictures of smart strong characters, with someone who spent a life in training or maybe a chosen one destined to change the world. Although technically Bilbo is chosen, the way the story address it and develops around it you don\u2019t think of him as a hero, at least I didn\u2019t, not more than I would think of myself if I were in his position, and here where the story gets me, because I do feel I\u2019m in his position from the very beginning. I think Bilbo managed to be this unusual yet relatable hero, because of how human he was in this inhumanly world, how nice he was or at least tried to be to Gandalf and the Dwarves even when they made him uncomfortable and how he saved them even when they needed saving from themselves.<br /><br />I can see myself reading this for my kids one day, and it won\u2019t be boring, it\u2019s still going to be an enjoyable and fun journey, because it\u2019s gold and gold does not rust with time. This story is associated with only beautiful things in my mind, in fact the whole time writing this review I can\u2019t help but think of sunny spring fields and cold breezes.<br /><br />I loved the world in this book and I mean this book, because I haven\u2019t read the other Middle Earth books but I still love it, it was so vast and beautiful, it wouldn\u2019t be the same journey if it was set in a different world.<br /><br />I feel I\u2019m not doing the other characters justice because so far I only talked about Bilbo but the truth is I love them all. Gandalf is probably my favorite besides Bilbo but I also love Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin. The other character I loved is Beorn, I don\u2019t know why but I just did and the whole thing with him and Gandalf and how the Dwarves didn\u2019t come all at once, I really loved that part.<br /><br />I watched the movies and I enjoyed them but they didn\u2019t reflect the joy I had reading this book. The movies were darker, they were more about war but the book was more about the journey. This is probably the only time a movie has been bigger than the book but to be fair the movies built the story to be a prequel to The Lord of the Rings and they had a lot more than what was in this book to build upon. The movies hold the main story of the book and I\u2019ll be happy if every movie adaptation was like this, they all should. I have to say that the cinematography and all the landscapes were exceptional and it reflects the beautiful world in the book.<br /><br />The other thing I loved about the movies is the soundtracks, I cannot express how much I loved that, it was one of the best things about the movies, because I loved the poems in the book and the movies didn\u2019t disappoint on that account, the best one has got to be The Misty Mountains Cold, it was one of my favorite parts in the book, and the music in the movie made it perfect, I only wish they made a bit longer. Every time I hear it, I want to grow a beard and go on an adventure.",

I truly respect J. R.R Tolkien. If I'm not mistaken, this was one of the first really popular fantasy books ever written. And fantasy just happens to be my favourite genre. So you can see why I really wanted to like this book. I wanted to like it so much, in fact, that I have tried to read it <b>three times now</b>.

After the supposed \"third time's a charm\" attempt failed, I moved on to the films. And I really enjoyed them. (Well, I didn't like how they stretched one book into three movies, but that's a discussion for another time.)

Jansson\u2019s book conveys an innocence rarely found in modern titles. An undeniable charm exudes from her fanciful characters \u2013 the same type of odd yet memorable creatures one anticipates finding in an L. Frank Baum novel. <br><br>Moomins have a simple way of life. Their relaxed attitudes, gardens, and lovingly prepared meals are reminiscent of Tolkien\u2019s hobbits. In fact, Jansson\u2019s descriptions of the whimsical setting often invoke the sense that one is reading about an alternate Shire \u2013 a feeling made more robust by Moomintroll and his friends journeying to the Lonely Mountains. <br><br><i>Halfway up the hill on their way grew a clump of blue-trees covered with big yellow pears, and of course they couldn\u2019t get past that without Sniff deciding that he was hungry.</i> <br><br><i>It certainly looked mysterious. Overhead the branches of the plum trees, oaks, and silver poplars met and formed a dark tunnel which led away into the unknown.</i> <br><br>Despite the impending threat of a comet hitting the earth, Moomintroll and his companions are relatively carefree. They remain (mostly) focused in their task to hurry home as they're shuffled from one peculiar instance to the next. The narrative lacks a sense of urgency, yet there\u2019s something cathartic about the sweet simplicity of Moomintroll\u2019s adventure. <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1509466767i/24324629._SY540_.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"443\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Sprinkled with darling illustrations, <i>Comet in Moominland</i> is a gentle tale of friendship and family.",

I know the Swedish original well, and I figured that it should be easy to read and would improve my sketchy vocabulary. That worked out even better than I had hoped, and I already feel measurably more confident. <br /><br />What surprised me, though, was that for once I experienced the translation as utterly convincing. Not has been casting scorn on my claims here, and asking the obvious questions: given that my German is terrible, how can I know this is brilliant? But I just know. Even though I'm no good at the language, I have heard it spoken a great deal, and I understand how it's pronounced. I can hear it in my head when I'm reading, and it sounds exactly like the Swedish original. Everything is there. The rhythm of the narrative, with its ironic alternation of comedy and tragedy; the charming dialogues between the unforgettable characters; even the made-up names. It's a little miracle. The English translation is quite different. I can understand every word, rather than having to guess a quarter of them, but the soul of the book has disappeared. It isn't Tove Jansson any more.<br /><br />If you know German, and haven't read it already, get yourself a copy. It's just one of the best children's books ever written.<br />",

I particularly loved the out-of-touch astronomers at the observatory, who have calculated exactly when the comet will strike (\"possibly four seconds later,\" they add scrupulously), but seem completely uninterested by the fact that it will wipe out everyone in Moomin Valley. <br /><br />In case you're worried, though, the Moomin family is more than a match for one little rogue comet, and Moominpappa's wonderfully absurd solution saves the day. The writing in the original Swedish is impeccable; Jansson's unique blend of humor, melancholy and acute observation all comes together perfectly. I think this is her best book, and have read it several times. Suitable for anyone from eight to eighty-eight.<br />",

    "text": "REVIEW OF THE 1970 GERMAN TRANSLATION BY VIVICA AND KURT BANDLER<br /><br />This here (and unfortunately also extremely rare and generally rather massively expensive if indeed even available used online) Ravensburger Taschenb\u00fccher German language translation of Tove Jansson's <u>Komet im Mumintal</u> (which Swedish language original title on the Goodreads database is <u>Kometer kommer</u>, although Vivica and Kurt Bandler's 1970 translation actually claims the original title to have been <u>Kometjakten</u>) was one of my favourite childhood reads (a book that I received in a large stack of about twenty Ravensburger Taschenb\u00fccher as a birthday present in 1975, a book that I took with me when we immigrated to Canada in 1976 and that I even carried along in my trunk when I went to university in New Brunswick in 1985, where it unfortunately ended up somehow disappearing during one of those silly residence \"panty raids\" during frosh week, and oh boy, was I ever both sad and seriously, lastingly peeved because of that). <br /><br />And honestly, to and for me personally, Vivica and Kurt Bandler's translation (and I finally did locate a reasonably intact and not too shabby copy online a couple of years ago), it still and absolutely feels as THE ONE German language version of <u>Komet im Mumintal</u> I do love the most, as the more recent translation by Birgitta Kicherer at least in my opinion leaves way way too much to be desired and in particular that it fails to present far too many important details, such as for example patently ignoring the little silk monkey, who though strangely and incomprehensibly is still featured in Tove Jannsson's accompanying illustrations but has textually seemingly been textually forgotten by Kicherer (albeit that according to readers who have read the original Swedish version, Kicherer supposedly does include parts that were left out by the Bandlers in 1970, but I for one simply cannot handle the removal of that delightful little silk monkey). And sorry, but with Elizabeth Portch's English language translation, with <u>Comet in Moominland</u> (which I did try and originally had quite high hopes for) her writing style, her narrational renderings expression and cadence wise, they both just do not at least for me in any way capture the delightful magic of the story, as they tend to make me feel aloof, above and beyond, and not really rooting for and exploring with Moomin, Sniff, Snuffkin and the rest of the group (but just dispassionately observing them and theirs). <br /><br />However, while I do personally and always will prefer the Bandlers' 1970 German language translation, their 1970 rendition of <u>Komet im Mumintal</u>, I would still if recommending this second Moomin novel most definitely suggest Elizabeth Portch\u2019s English language translation, I would absolutely recommend <u>Comet in Moominland</u> before I would in any way even consider recommending Birgitta Kicherer's more recent German language rendition, as the latter just really and frustratingly bothers me to on end with its additions and especially with its annoying subtractions and abridgements (and sorry, but even if it is indeed true that the recent German translation contains parts that appear in the Swedish original and do not appear in the 1970 translation, the little silk monkey has always been a personal favourite and I was quite seeing red so to speak when I could not find her textually in the Birgitta Kicherer translation). And indeed, if you speak and read German and are actually able to find Vivica and Kurt Bandler's 1970 Ravensburger Taschenb\u00fccher translation online, yes, do consider reading their <u>Komet im Mumintal</u>, with its reddish and orange hued book cover of Moomin, Sniff, Snuffkin et al crossing the evaporated ocean on their stilts, as it truly is a lovely, evocative and fun, as well as occasionally eye-opening romp, a fantastical experience for young and old.<br /><br />And finally with regard to Tove Jansson\u2019s featured themes and contents, what I love the most lastingly about <u>Komet im Mumintal</u> (and actually, this pertains to all of the Moomin books I have read so far) are the delightfully anecdotal episodes, which although generally complete in themselves also never feel as though they are hanging in space so to speak, as though there is not a thread of continuity from beginning to end, with the chapters seamlessly moving from the first inklings that a comet could perhaps be arriving to the fateful day it does (and how close the earth comes to disaster). But for me even more importantly (and probably the main reason why I have always so much adored the Moomin novels both as a child and now as an adult) I have so much appreciated how very much humanely and with personal understanding and supportiveness, Jansson describes and presents her diverse and often rather intriguing characters, and yes that even those individuals who show potentially problematic or negative behaviour patterns (such as Sniff, the Hemulens and even the silent, creepy Hattifatteners) are shown not only as negative but also with positiveness and much authorial understanding (and considering that the Hemulens, for example, with their OCD like obsessions and neuro-atypical ways and means could easily be considered as being on the autism spectrum, the Moomin books are in my humble opinion also interesting and important discussion vehicles, especially considering that these novels were for the most part penned at a time when autism and other such syndromes were not as yet really part of public awareness and the public conscience).",

    "text": "Just revisited this book for the first time in a long while by reading it aloud to my 6 year-old. Two main thoughts:<br /><br />1. I love Tove Jansson. She always writes with a slightly off-beat charm (one of my favorite bits in this book is the title of the butterfly collecting Hemulin's book, <i> Moths of the Eastern Hemisphere: their Behavior and Misbehavior</i>) and her stories tend to swing uneasily between the surreal (Hattifatteners, anyone?) and the comforting (coffee and cake), a style which I found somewhat confusing as a child, but came to adore when I reread the books in college. However, this is one of her earliest books, and it shows. After Moomintroll and his friends learn that a comet is threatening the earth, they travel to an observatory to learn more about it. Much of the story consists of them encountering one peril after another on their long journey. It gets a little repetitive, and that contributes to a general flatness and lack of emotional depth to this book. Also there's some rather tedious gender stereotyping in the relationship between Moomintroll and the Snork Maiden -- even as a child, I thought the Snork Maiden was overdoing the damsel in distress act. But I can forgive Jansson all this for the wonderful chapter about crossing the dried up sea on stilts.<br /><br />2. This perhaps was not the best choice of book to read aloud to a child who is already prone to fanatsizing and worring about calamatous events, such as the sun blowing up. But I told him it had a happy ending (that's not a spoiler, right? I mean we know they're not wiped out by the comet because of all the sequels), and he enjoyed it a lot, and I loved reading it aloud. We are ready to start <i>Finn Family Moomintroll</i>!<br /><br />ETA: Days after finishing this, I've decided to change my review to four stars, because despite its flaws the book has stuck with me, and the writing was so lovely and the penultimate chapter so exciting. <br />",

Now, to honor Tove Jansson's centenary, I started a project of reading all her Moomin books. Maybe the rest of her body of work as well, if I have the time or enthusiasm.<br /><br />When the 1992 animated movie premiered in Finland, my mom took me to see it. The part where Muskrat sits on the cake was funny, but mostly the oppressive mood stayed with me. I don't remember the happy ending, but I do remember the part where creatures big and small were hurrying away from Moominvalley with all their possessions, the frantic search for the kitten, and the red sky that reminded of the impending doom.<br /><br />The book is very similar to the movie with minor differences (the change of the chump Silk Monkey into a kitten worked better in my opinion), and has echoes of nuclear explosions and their scorching power to destroy everything. Everyone in the valley has their way of surviving in the middle of an increasing dread of an uncertain future. Moominmamma just keeps going with her chores and bakes a cake, but Moomintroll and Sniff travel to the Observatory of the Lonely Mountains to find out more about the approaching comet. On their journey they meet other familiar characters who join the Moomin family.<br /><br />The contrast between them all works great (Sniff is a selfish whiner, the fickle Snork Maiden is vain and loves beautiful things, and the practical Snork is obsessed about details and having meetings about everything). There's a little of them in all of us. Snufkin is my favorite, and here we meet him for the first time. He sees beauty even in the starkest of sceneries and proves to be a great asset to the group with his experience in adventures.<br /><br /><blockquote>\n  <i>\"It was a funny little path, winding here and there, dashing off in different directions, and sometimes even tying a knot in itself from sheer joy.

    "text": "REVIEW OF THE ELIZABETH PORTCH TRANSLATION<br /><br />No, I am just not all that much textually enamoured of Elizabeth Portch's translation of Tove Jansson's 1946 <u>Kometjakten</u>, I really have not (the two times I did try) enjoyed reading <u>Comet in Moominland</u> even remotely as much as I have always oh so totally adored Vivica and Kurt Bandler's 1970 German language translation (their exquisite <u>Komet im Muminland</u>), which was one of my favourite childhood novels and which I have indeed adored just as much during my recent rereads.<br /><br />And indeed, it really and obviously is the general narrative flow of the Elizabeth Portch translation that seems to bother me and take away quite a large amount of potential narrative magic, as well as the annoying fact that far too often and in my opinion, Portch presents English vocabulary choices in her rendering into English of Tove Jansson's original Swedish text that read and feel idiomatically awkward, such as for example her using the word swear as a noun instead of the much more natural sounding oath (two words that might well mean the same semantically, but well, for the context of <u>Comet in Moominland</u>, oath totally sounds better and much less artificial), and therefore, leaving <u>Comet in Moominland</u> thematically in most ways quite as delightful for me as <u>Komet im Muminland</u> has always been but stylistically rather hugely frustrating and majorly aggravating. For yes, with regard to Tove Jansson\u2019s featured themes and contents, what I love the most lastingly about the Bandlers' translation, about <u>Komet im Mumintal</u>, this actually totally also pertains Elizabeth Portch's rendition, also holds generally true for <u>Comet in Moominland</u>, as the delightfully anecdotal episodes, although generally complete in and of themselves never seem to feel as though they are hanging in space so to speak, as though there is not a thread of continuity from beginning to end in both <u>Komet im Muminland</u> and <u>Comet in Moominland</u>, with the chapters seamlessly moving from the first inklings that a comet could perhaps be arriving to the fateful day it does (and how close the earth comes to total and utter disaster). <br /><br />However, for me even more importantly (and probably one of the main reasons why I have always so much adored the Moomin novels on a content and themed based level both as a child and now as an adult) I really do appreciate how very much humanely and with personal understanding and supportiveness, Jansson (and by extension her translators) describe and present her diverse and often rather intriguing characters, and that even those individuals who show potentially problematic or negative behaviour patterns (such as Sniff, the Hemulens and even the silent, creepy Hattifatteners) are shown and presented not only as negative but also with positiveness and much authorial understanding (and considering that the Hemulens, for example, with their OCD like obsessions and neuro-atypical ways and means could easily be considered as perhaps being on the autism spectrum, the Moomin books are in my humble opinion also interesting and important discussion vehicles, especially considering that these stories were for the most part penned by Tove Jansson at a time when autism and other such syndromes were not as yet really part of public awareness and the public conscience).<br /><br />But unfortunately, the for and to my personal reading tastes more than a trifle substandard quality of Elizabeth Portch's translation of <u>Kometjakten</u>, of Tove Jansson\u2019s original Swedish (even if I do indeed have no content and thematic based bones of contention), this does definitely and indeed take away quite a bit of potential joy of reading for <u>Comet in Moominland</u> (and to make me even more appreciative of the exquisite and wonderful magic of Vivica and Kurt Bandler's rendition, of their 1970 <u>Komet im Muminland</u>) and to thus and unfortunately also consider both <u>Comet in Moominland</u> and Elizabeth Portch as translator rather mediocre at best, still to be thematically recommended of course, but yes, if you do read German and if you are able to locate a copy of the Bandlers' 1970 (and sadly usually quite rare and expensive) <u>Komet im Muminland</u>, to most definitely read this instead (but of course, I am also rather majorly biased here, but I do stand by this since both personally and with regard to narrative style I strongly consider Elizabeth Portch as not really a very decent translator of Tove Jansson, since well, I have also not really enjoyed <u>Finn Family Moomintroll</u> either and indeed mostly because of Portch's textually frustrating lack of decent translation efforts).",

I happened across it by accident and spent much time in enjoyable confusion about the names and natures of the seemingly infinite cast of characters. This year I decided I wanted to find out more than my hazy memories could tell me and in the process stumbled across the fact that Tove Jansson had written and drawn a Moomin strip comic for a British newspaper and I acquired the first volume of the collected strip comics and read it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it densely but gently satirical as well as pleased to find that the bizarre imagination (particularly for characters who are mythic or completely invented creatures) was most definitely as I recalled.<br /><br />This meant I still didn't know what the novels were like, but encouraged by the high quality of the comic strip and my memories, I decided to give Comet in Moominland a go - selected because it was the first written (though not first published, I think) of the Moomin novels. <br /><br />It turned out to be a delightful, pleasant book, strong on imagined characters and incidental mystery - what is a Snufkin? Just how much difference is there between a Troll and a Snork? Everybody and everything is introduced blithely as if common-place without any real requirement for detailed explanation. Everybody knows what a Hattifattener is, really - description is almost superfluous.<br /><br />The plot is epic compared to those in the volume of comic strips I read - the fate of Moomin Valley (and the rest of the world, really) is at stake and an arduous journey is undertaken to request knowledge and help in saving the day.<br /><br />The gentle satire is present but in lesser quantity - a philosopher who states that everything is Unnecessary, is never-the-less rather keen on creature comforts (all the more so because he is a creature - a Muskrat)and not being destroyed by the impact of a celstial body. Not keen enough to actually help avert the crisis, however. The scientists that Moomintroll appeals to for information and help take no interest, but pour out all their knowledge to the Snork Maiden when asked about their work...<br /><br />Contrast of characters is also used to give a Message about the moral and physical dangers of too much attachment to physical belongings (a sentiment expressed in the comic strip, too). The characters are also used to promote the virtues of friendship and familial love. Moomintroll's faith that his mother, Moominmama will fix everything if only they can get back to her in time, is touching - hasn't there been a time in all our lives when we had absolute faith that Mum could resolve any problem satisfactorily? <br /><br />I suppose it is not too much of a spoiler to reveal that Moomintroll, friends and family, The Valley of the Moomins and even the rest of the planet survive to return in more books; I look forward to reading them.<br /><br />I would say that comparing Comic Strip vol.1 to Novel 1, the strip has just a slight edge in my opinion because it is more densely packed with satire, but that a greater focus on plot is suited to the novel as a form, so perhaps each should be enjoyed for their own merits and comparison should not be dwelled on too much.<br /><br />Now, if only some-one would tell me what order the rest of the novels are meant to be read in....<br />",

    "text": "I have to say that my experience of the Moomins was limited to a rather disturbing animated series from my childhood (okay it unsettled me) so when I stumbled across the history of these iconic characters I was more than a little intrigued. <br /><br />So here I am working through the collectors edition learning the original stories that have endured so long and I have to say that reading the first in the series (it was neither the first book I had read from Tove Jansson nor it transpires is it the first in the series) of the collectors editions the first things that struck me was how dark the story was.<br /><br />I will not give it away nor will I say that it was not an endearing story but really any story that presents the end of the world (at least for the Moomins) is off to a dark start and no I am not giving anything away considering the cover of this edition. <br /><br />However I can say that there is still the charm and warmth of the various characters you would expect and I have to admit that this book has all the greater resonance for it. <br /><br />As for it NOT being the first in the series - that would be the great flood - it would seem that was not released in this format or at least is no longer recognised as it - oh well back to hunting down that one now as it was referenced a number of times and it does feel like cheating starting a series mid-way through.

The ending had me on the edge of my seat in a race against time and impending disaster as a comet speeds toward earth!<br /><br />After finding foreboding patterns of comets in the forest and being told by Muskrat that a comet is approaching earth, Moomintroll and his buddy, Sniff, set out to find the observatory in the Lonely Mountains and find out more information from the professors there. They have questions like, \"Will it hit the earth?\" and \"When?!\"<br /><br />This twelve chapter book (some chapters long, some short) is filled with adventure, danger, crocodiles, giant lizards, poisonous bushes, swarms of grasshoppers, a tornado and a race to return home! Will they make it?! <br /><br />Moomintroll exhibits the same lovely character traits as he did in Moominland Midwinter - kindness, compassion, bravery, selflessness, curiosity and enthusiasm. He rescues the charming Snork Maiden and a beautiful and loving friendship develops.<br /><br />Comet in Moominland was the first full length book about the Moomins, written after Tove Jansson's first Moomin story, The Moomins and the Great Flood. Tove Jansson's delightful black and white illustrations perfectly detail and lend great visuals to the story. In the front of this paperback book, there is a three page Moominland Gallery of illustrations of the different characters in Moominland and their names. The back of the book has a brief biography of Tove Jansson, a timeline of her works and brief descriptions of eight of the Moominland books available in paperback.",

    "text": "Okay, I have to say that I picked this book up partly due to all the hype (and partly because it's involved two of my favorite genres)... I mean, so many people had recommended it to me and I finally got sick of hearing about it, so I picked it up and read it... or as least <b>tried</b> to.<br /><br />Let me first say that I am a <b>huge</b> romance and vampire/supernatural fan, so when I first heard about the book I was really excited to read it because it combined two of my favorite genres.<br /><br />But, I really regret ever buying and forcing myself to finish it (I hate not finishing books, even if I hate them), it was so bad. Though, let me tell you that I <b>really</b> wanted to like it, really I did... I'm one of those people who likes a lot of popular things, Twilight was popular, so I figured... I would love it just like everyone else, but I was very, <i>very</i> wrong. <br /><br />A lot of fans wonder why I hate the book so much and here is my list and it's a pretty long one, so get ready:<br /><br />1. Lack of characterization:<br />Bella- Okay... I absolutely <b>hated</b> this girl. She was the <b>worst</b> female protagonist I have ever read about! She's stupid, shallow, selfish and just plain annoying! Not to mention she's pathetically dependent on Edward... I mean, come on, NO girl should be <b>that</b> dependent on a boy, not only is that pathetic, but it is <i>very</i> unhealthy. She was also a clumsy little damsel in distress who was dumb enough to get herself into situations that she couldn't get out of. I would have <i>loved</i> for Meyer to have given her a backbone, so she could have done something useful instead of whining and doing stupid, idiotic things that no remotely intelligent teenage girl would actually do. Not to mention the fact that she is apparently very \"plain\" looking... if that's the case then why are there several guys fawning over her? (And, according to Meyer, one of them is a teacher... um, ew). Bella is a Mary Sue, simple as that. And I <i>hate</i> Mary Sues.<br />Edward- Okay, this boy is just <b>way</b> too possessive and stalkerish (it is <i>not</i> romantic of him to sneak into Bella's room and watch her sleep! It's creepy and wrong!) Oh, and \"bad boys\" usually don't sit there and say \"I'm dangerous, stay away\" etc. all the time... I also hated the fact that Bella described some part of his body every other page. It was completely UNNECESSARY!! Okay, we get the fact that he's hot, Bella... now MOVE ON! <br /><br />I could go on and on about all the characters... every single one of them was a flat, cardboard cut-out that did not seem realistic at all.<br /><br />2. Writing style:<br />Purple Prose- Ew... to this... seriously, all the purple prose made me want to throw the book across the room. Enough said. <br /><br />3. Descriptions:<br />I know I said up there that I got sick of reading about how gorgeous some part of Edward's body was every other paragraph... and if that wasn't bad enough... what's worse than is the fact that even with all that unnecessary description of him and everyone else (though mostly him, since Bella is <i>that</i> shallow) I still had a hard time picturing him or any of the characters in my head, for that matter. I also had a hard time picturing a lot of the setting and the action in my head as well. It's kind of sad really... there was <i>so</i> much description, you would think that everything (Edward especially) would be embedded into my brain, but no. That's what makes me wonder why so many fans find Edward so \"hot\", I never got a clear picture of him in my head to even begin to form an opinion about whether he was \"hot\" or not.<br /><br />Seriously, Meyer completely abused the dictionary and the thesaurus while writing this book (so much so that I think she should never be allowed to look at either one ever again)... there are so many big descriptive words used that could be replaced by smaller words that look and sound better. Half the time the words that she does use doesn't really go with what she's trying to say. Simply put: Stephenie Meyer is a moron and doesn't know that when writing you are supposed to use the thesaurus <i>sparingly</i> (aka: only when it is <i>truly</i> needed and not any time you damn well please), it really ruins everything if it's used too much... as Meyer has perfectly portrayed with this atrocious book.<br /><br />4. Plot:<br />Okay, the plot gets it's own category because it pissed me off so much. I mean, seriously... where was it?! It was nothing but sappy, gag worthy fluff between Edward and Bella until page 400 or so, when something <i>finally</i> happened. And, even then... it went by so fast and was not explained well at all (since Bella conveniently fainted during it, which is such a cop out). It seemed to me that Meyer just threw it in there, and it was only put there in the first place, so that she could point at it and say, \"Look, there's a plot right there.\", when people like me came around and said otherwise. But that's not a plot!! The plot should not take 400 pages to start! And no the whole \"romance\" between Bella and Edward is <i>not</i> the plot! This is especially the case since we knew from the beginning... thanks to the moronic give away on the back cover that states that Bella and Edward were going to fall in love... speaking of that, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to give away the fact that Edward was a vampire on the back cover?! I mean... really?! That took away any suspense/mystery the book might have had for the reader about what he was... so, while Bella was stupidly wondering what he was, I was sitting there yelling at her for being such a moron and not seeing what was right in front of her.<br /><br />5. Plot holes <br />The one thing that drove me absolutely CRAZY was the the fact that no one in the small town of Forks noticed that the Cullens <i>never</i> aged! And the \"children\" never graduated and went on to college. I mean, if they've been there for more than four years, than I'm assuming that <i>someone</i> would have noticed! I mean, the town could not be full of <i>that</i> many morons! <b>(Okay... I've been told several times that Cullens have only been living in Forks for about two years... I guess all the purple prose distracted me from reading and remembering that little detail...)</b> Speaking of school, why in the world would they willingly choose to take high school over and over again? Especially since they all have several college degrees (which leads me to wonder why, since they are so \"human loving\" they can't do something useful with their education like Carlisle, instead of sitting on their butts all day and just being useless) I know they need to \"fit in\", but seriously.. . that's just stupid... they could always pretend that they're home schooled (it's not <i>that</i> uncommon these days). Since that's how the Cullens fit into society, that means they have to move every four or five years to avoid suspicion, right? Wow... that must really suck. However, they wouldn't have to do that if they didn't put the younger ones in school since if they were in the workforce (and being useful to society) then they could stay for a lot longer before people started wondering why they don't age. But, I think I know why Edward and his \"siblings\" tortured themselves day after day by going to high school... Stephenie Meyer wasn't creative enough to come up with any other way for Edward and Bella to meet. It would have made more sense for them to have been neighbors or something. I can come up with several nice ideas about how that would have turned out and it would have been much better.<br /><br />I've been told that there are more, but those are the two that really bugged me. Though, I love the fans response to the mention of any plot hole (the rabid ones, not the sane ones, of course). It usually goes like this: \"Well it <i>is</i> a fictional vampire book.\" That's a stupid reason. Just because it's a book with vampires doesn't mean it's exempt from having to be realistic and not having glaring plot holes.<br /><br />I've also been told that there are even more in later books, but I'm not about to torture myself by reading the rest of the series just to find them and list them... I have better things to do with my time... like reading books that are actually good and not a waste of my time or money.<br /><br />6. Vampires<br />Like I said before, I'm a big vampire fan. But, this book is an embarrassment to vampire fiction. The vampires are pathetic, sweet, innocent, almost \"misunderstood\" creatures. I know that Meyer has every right to create her own idea about vampires. And, to be honest, I was okay with her idea about vampires until they started sparkling. <b>VAMPIRES DON'T SPARKLE</b>! To have them sparkle takes away the evilness of the myth of the creatures (since, they <i>are</i> creatures of the devil...at least, originally, they were). Evil creatures <i>do not</i> sparkle, the idea's laughable at best. Most normal people are not scared of something that <b>sparkles in the sun</b>. I mean, I know if I saw someone sparkling; I would not immediately think \"vampire\" and run. Not only because I don't associate sparkling with vampires, but also because how the hell is sparkling evil or scary?! By the way, the whole sparkling vampire idea just seemed to be there because Meyer wanted a reason as to why the vampires could even walk around in the daylight to begin with. The idea was just a convenient way for her to write the vampires. Since, she's incapable of coming up with a better, much more creative idea. I don't mind the fact that they could come out during the day (since that's not unheard of in vampire fiction nowadays), but I wish that Meyer had come up with a better idea that didn't make me laugh uncontrollably at the thought. <br /><br />All the other myths about vampires are nonexistent. Holy water and garlic won't bother them (just like the sun), stake through the heart won't kill them either, even beheading them won't get rid of them. She made her vampires practically invincible (which is annoying). The only way to really kill one of her vampires is to rip it apart and burn the pieces or to blow it up. Two things that a human would have a hard time doing... which, makes me wonder why, if they're so invincible, they live in secrecy? Especially since (from my knowledge) most vampires don't live like the Cullens, they could careless about humans. If most other vampires were so cruel, why don't they come out to humanity and take over? It makes a lot more sense since a mere human would have a very difficult time killing just one vampire. The fact that they had no weaknesses annoyed the crap out of me. Along with being almost invincible, they all had these special \"powers\", but they didn't have the bad side effects with them, only the good. All in all, her vampires were perfect.<br /><br />I don't like my vampires to be blood thirsty monsters that kill everything in sight. But, I also don't want them to be so pathetic and innocent either. The only two vampiric qualities that are there are the ones that are well known among everyone: drinking blood (well, sort of since the Cullens are \"vegetarian\" vampires; an idea that seriously made me laugh) and being immortal. Otherwise, the Cullens are disgustingly human like.<br /><br />I think the thing I have the problem with the most is the fact that Meyer has never seen any vampire movies/t.v. shows or read any vampire novels. There's this saying in regards to writing: \"Write what you know\". Stephenie Meyer knew nothing about vampires when she wrote this horrible excuse for a vampire novel (which is probably why it was so awful in comparison to other vampire novels, whether those books are in the romance section of the bookstore or the horror/sci-fi section). A good author always does their research (whether it's fiction or non-fiction is irrelevant). This doesn't mean that she needed to go by the other myths, it just means that she should have done a little research to see what she was getting herself into. If she had done this, I would have been able to respect her ideas more because at least then she would have done her research. <br /><br />Where the vampires are concerned, this novel is an embarrassment to vampire/supernatural fiction.<br /><br />7. Messages<br />I am somewhat appalled at the messages that this book sends out.. they are so anti-feminist, it's disgusting:<br />1. It's perfectly okay to have no goals or aspirations or even an education, just get yourself a man and he'll take care of you. <i>(All Bella wants is to be with Edward, some aspirations, huh?)</i><br />2. It's also perfectly okay to like someone because of their physical features... this is not love people, it's lust! They have nothing in common! He likes her because she smells nice and she likes him because he's hot. <i>(Bella goes on and on and on about how <i>hot</i> some part of Edward is every other page)</i><br />3. When you have several guys fawning over you pick the hottest one of them all because looks are <i>so</i> very important. <i>(Mike and Eric pretty much say the same thing to Bella on her first day of school, but she's nicer to Mike than Eric because the latter wasn't very attractive. Also, she picks Edward because of his looks as well)</i><br />4. It's okay if the guy you love sneaks into your bedroom and watches you sleep at night (before you even know him all that well)... that's completely normal and romantic... not the the least bit creepy or stalkerish. <i>(It's completely disgusting to hear girls talk about this. They swoon and gush about how romantic it is... seriously, what is</i> wrong <i>with people these days?!)</i><br />5. It is perfectly okay to become completely obsessed with your boyfriend and depend on him for <i>everything</i>.<i>(Bella's obsession and dependence on Edward sets feminism back a couple hundred years or so)</i><br />6. It also teaches that not only is it okay to change yourself for a guy, but it's also okay to give up EVERYTHING for him as well. <i>(Bella wants to become a vampire and leave her family and friends to be with Edward. What. The. Hell.)</i><br />7. Your life is not complete until you find a man. <i>(This is nothing but a LIE. Girls do not need a man to be complete)</i><br /><br />Like with the plot holes, I've been told that there are many more terrible messages in later books and once again, I'm not about to go out and read the books. However, I will say this... from what I've heard, they sound worse than the ones I've already listed.<br /><br />8. The Obsession:<br />Well, this gets its own category, mostly because I just don't understand what all the obsession is over... it's a book, and a poorly written one at that. I run across girls all the time arguing over who Edward \"belongs\" to... it's pathetic and kind of scary. He's a book character... he doesn't belong to anyone, but Meyer, since she's the one who created him.<br /><br />I also hate the fact that I can't go into the book store now without being bombarded with a huge display dedicated to this crappy series... makes me sick to see such praise and popularity for a mediocre book series when there are so much better authors out there that are virtually ignored since they write real fiction and none of this poorly written wish fulfillment fantasy crap.<br /><br />This was obviously a fulfillment story that I would expect a preteen to write on her livejournal. This is not a book I would expect a thirty something year old woman with a college education to write and actually attempt and then succeed in getting published. And, it was a degree in English... seriously, I would have expected <b>much</b> better from someone who had that degree... since she spent college studying books and analyzing them etc. you would think that she would know how to write one the proper way...<br /><br />Meyer could have made this book great, but no... instead she took the easy way out: a cliched, simple, overused plot and added vampires to it(as if that made it any different).<br /><br />Honestly, I've read better over on fictionpress.com... and that's really sad, because most of the authors over there are between the ages of 14 and 26 and are amateurs in the field. Maybe, if Meyer had posted this up there first, it would have been a <b>much</b> better story because the good writers over there would have set her straight. Maybe then, I would have been able to get through the novel, because it might have actually been good!<br /><br />And, oh just for the record... Twilight is <b>NOT</b> the next Harry Potter, nor is it better than Harry Potter... I say that not only because JK Rowling actually <b>has</b> talent, but also because they are in completely different genres and can't really be compared.<br /><br />Though, it <i>does</i> make me sick to see Harry Potter even mentioned in the same sentence as this piece of crap... (unfortunately, that couldn't be avoided in this review) and it's an insult to JK Rowling to have her amazing writing compared to the horrible writing of Stephenie Meyer.<br /><br />EDIT: I found this site, and thought I should share with everyone: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/page/1\">http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.c...</a><br />The creator of the above site has scanned copies of the Twilight books on to her computer and has taken it upon herself to point out the many issues that the books have (these are mostly grammatical in nature). If you are a fangirl who believes that Twilight is perfect and has no flaws then you should <i>really</i> take a look at this.",

Speaking of the beach trip, here is something the editors should have picked up on. When the beach trip is first brought up it's supposed to be happening in two weeks. But, as Bella goes on and on about nothing in particular, a few pages later she mentions <blockquote>\n  <i>\"...just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in <b>a half-dozen weeks</b>.\"</i>\n</blockquote> Wait, what? Anyone notice something? Six weeks have passed and the beach trip is where? Not only that, but the girl's choice dance was also two weeks away and here six weeks have passed...<blockquote>\n  <i>\"I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, <b>almost two months ago</b>.\"</i>\n</blockquote> Anyway, moving on. Some random shit happens causing Edward to swoop in and save danger prone Bella. The worst thing about <i>Twilight</i> is how incredibly dependent Bella is on Edward. When she's not with him, she is always thinking about him. And that doesn\u2019t make any sense. She barely knows him. They've had like two or three conversations and she has thoughts like: <blockquote>\n  <i>\"And what was my other choice--to cut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him.\"<br>\"It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now.\"<br>\"You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose.\"</i>\n</blockquote> And then, because Edward must always prove to Bella that he loves her more than she loves him, he pulls this line: <blockquote>\n  <i>\"Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most because if I can do it---if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.\"</i>\n</blockquote> Are you kidding me? This is not love. But how could it be, with Edward torn between eating her and making out with her? Edward is a controlling creepy creeper. He had been watching her sleep for weeks before they started talking! Meyer are you condoning stalkish behavior?! <a href=\"http://s181.photobucket.com/albums/x95/shellnick2003/?action=view&amp;current=photo-47.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380222758ra/287216.gif\" alt=\"Photobucket\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>Not.Fucking.Cool. <br><br>I once read that Stephenie Meyer had a dream and that is how <i>Twilight</i> was born.

It totally shows. While it's true the entire book is a shit storm in action, the second half is noticeably worse. The first half can easily be summed up as \"Bella's Bitch Fest meets Creep-ward\" and believe me when I say, it's really not as bad as the second half. How is that even possible? I have no idea, but Meyer pulls that shit off flawlessly. And ya know? I have a theory on that. Because Meyer had a dream about Bella and Edward and their 'true love' and she went to work on the second half before the first, there is all this raw emotions, strange pet names, and banter that's supposed to be romantic but fails miserably. I just felt terribly uncomfortable reading it. And to top it all off, it was so <b>bad</b>, like, eye bleeding bad! It made me so angry I actually pulled out a pen and started marking this damn book up. Don't believe me? LMAO, seriously folks, I took notes.

She doesn't write fight scenes. There was a huge build up for a fight with James and we see nothing of the fight. Bella is informed of what happened after the fact. Good job, Stephenie. You totally ripped off your readers there. So, Carlisle is sitting there fixing up Bella on the ground (and he randomly has Morphine, by the way -_-) and Bella is in the process of passing out. But first, Carlisle has a little conversation about Bella's mom and she somehow finds the will to mention to Alice what she knows about James. Like, really? Go to sleep Bella. You talk too much. <br><br>I won't bore you with the details of the ending. I'm sure you already know. But I do want to say that Bella's mother is the most selfish character (next to Bella, of course). First she ships her off to Forks so she could be with her new husband. And no, do not tell me Bella chose to do that. Renee is the parent and it's *her* job to make sacrifices. Then, when Bella is in the hospital after the fight with James, she acts like she can't be bothered to stay with Bella. <blockquote>\n  <i>Then she sighed and glaced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall.<br>\"Do you need to go?\"<br>She bit her lip. \"Phil's supposed to call in a little while...I didn't know you were going to wake up...\"</i>\n</blockquote> Really?? Really, Renee?! Your daughter almost died and you are seriously acting like this? Un-fucking-believable. Oh, but this shit gets better: <blockquote>\n  <i>\"I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know,\" she announced, proud of herself.</i>\n</blockquote> Huh? Do you want a cookie for that? It's your job! <blockquote>\n  <i>\"I can stay if you need me.\"<br>\"No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me.\"<br>She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay.<br>\"I'll be back tonight.\" Its sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it.</i>\n</blockquote> And what does she think Edward and Bella are going to do? She has a broken leg, broken ribs, and cracks in her skull. C'mon now!<br><br>Then Edward takes Bella to prom, he kisses her neck. The fucking end.<br>Would I recommend this? Bahahahahahah!

    "text": "Oh my. This book, to me, is like chocolate: a delicious, sinful, addictive indulgence which you convince yourself has beneficial qualities (zinc, calcium, keeps me quiet at that time of the month...) in order to justify your addiction.<br /><br />By \"beneficial qualities\", I mean that it's reading, and since when is reading bad? :) Let me say quite clearly that I'm a sucker for romance, especially the intense, passionate, tragic kind. I don't read romance novels*, though, because to me they are lacklustre - Meyer's book has the extra edge I need, though, a great way of keeping doom hanging over the main characters' heads: she's human, he's a vampire.<br /><br />Sound corny? Yeah, I know, and the only reason Meyer gets away with it as well as she does is because <i>Twilight</i> doesn't try to be anything it's not, and it has such conviction. Only Meyer could get away with giving her narrator the name Isabella Swan. She says in her little bio at the back that she wanted to write believable characters: an interesting choice, then, to write about vampires, but <i>I</i> believed in them, and without such a willing suspension of disbelief, the story would have been a farce. True, a lot of people <i>haven't</i> been able to suspend their disbelief with this book, but that doesn't affect <i>my</i> reading experience :)<br /><br />Seventeen year old Bella's parents are divorced. She lives with her mum in Phoenix, Arizona, and spends time with her dad Charlie in Forks, Washington State, where it rains almost constantly. She hates Forks, but when her mum remarries a baseball player, Phil, and starts travelling with him, Bella decides to move to Forks.<br /><br />On her first day at school she notices the isolated group of five beautiful, graceful siblings. Rosalie, Alice, Emmet, Edward and Jasper. One in particular catches her eye: Edward Cullen, with his rust-brown hair and topaz eyes. She is more than a little surprised and shocked when he seems to have developed an acute, profound hatred of her. Her fascination deepens, especially when, after a brief disappearance, he saves her life. She soon figures out what Edward is, and the knowledge doesn't frighten her. The shaky friendship between them develops into something much stronger, and Edward reveals his overpowering reaction to her smell that nearly made him kill her on the spot - hence the look on his face that so shocked her, and the restraint he put on himself during an hour of Biology.<br /><br />Let's not forget he's incredibly handsome: even though Bella describes almost every glance he makes and every twitch of his lips, not once did I get bored and roll my eyes. My fascination grew alongside hers, until I too fell in love with Edward - in a totally girly, daydreamy way. Yes, I admit it. I don't know if that makes this a girly kind of book - these days those boundaries don't seem to matter so much, and the vampire family is pretty darn cool, what with Edward's extra ability to read minds, Alice's premonitions, Jasper's ability to affect people's emotions, their speed, their invincibility... Bella is at one point compared to Lois Lane, because Edward and his kin really are like Superman.<br /><br />One of the things I love about YA books: the clarity with which they are written. Granted there is some repetition in <i>Twilight</i>, but to me it's necessary repetition. There's nothing superfluous in <i>Twilight</i>, nothing that shouldn't be there, and the flow, the pacing, is great. It's a fat book, but I read it in two days. I read it with breakfast, on my walk to the subway, on the subway, up the escalator, through the ticket gates, to work, in my lunch break ... you get the picture. I couldn't get enough of it, and it left me with that same craving for more that Harry Potter did (I remember scrounging around for loose change as soon as I finished one of them and dashing off into the city to get my next fix. It helped that four were already out when I started). There's plenty of negative stuff you could say about this book - the writing, the characters, the obsession - but again, I couldn't care less :)<br /><br />Another thing I loved was all the vampire myths Meyer scrapped. These vampires aren't burnt to ash by sunlight: their marble skin glitters as the sunlight is broken into miniscule shards, like diamonds - hence why they are living in Forks, where the sun hardly ever shines. They are not hurt by crucifixes or stakes through the heart. They do not\u00a0sleep at all, nor do they eat human food. They drive fast cars really really fast. And they can fall in love. Awwww.<br /><br />Seriously though, this was one of most fun, most enjoyable, most romantic books I've read in a long time, and I'm so happy there are two more out with a fourth on the way. They are, somewhat predictably, making <i>Twilight</i> into a movie - still in the early development stage - but it's rather fun to go to the author's website and see her own preferences for actors to play Edward etc. Can't say I'm familiar with most of them, but her top choice (now sadly too old), is indeed a perfect match. Who knows who they'll really cast, but as with the book, the characters have to be right or the whole story will be just silly and sappy.<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />*Since reading this the first time back in 2007, I've started reading some romance novels. Yes I've been corrupted. Or rather, I've always loved romance stories but had trouble admitting it. Now, I just don't care :)",

    "text": "I hate this book. I will probably end up reading the rest of them, because if I don't, people that love this thing will think they can convert me if I just keep reading. (<b>ETA (Jan. 2013):</b> Never even remotely bothered to finish the series. I said that as a joke to begin with, and I did not finish the series. Did not finish them, not for irony's sake or for amusement's sake or as some kind of amulet to ward off kind-hearted Twimoms that would encourage me with \"they get better!\" I hope that clears that up for some folks that seem to have had a tough time with \"I did not finish them.\" One last time for posterity: I can pretty much be defined as a Person That Would Be Caught Dead in a Dumpster Before Reading the Rest of These Damn Books. So long as we're all clear on that now, ONWARD!)<br /><br />In short: the writing mechanics are <i>atrocious.</i> The dialogue is stilted and absolutely wretched. The characterization is bad-- loose, jumpy, and the progression is occasionally senseless. The main characters themselves are not compelling: selfish, shallow, lacking the deep thought that comes with true passion and love and instead leaping recklessly into stupid and deadly situations when anyone with a brain could see sixty other possibilities that should have been tried first.<br /><br />I can't express my disgust for the relationship between Edward and Bella. It's not romance, it's not passion, it's not love. It's selfish idiocy at best. Bella as a character is insufferable: her self-sacrificing streak is not compassion, it's sheer stupidity. It's hormones. It's a bad, bad example for the teenage girls who read it. Bella's whole life is tied up in her boyfriend. She has no goals, passions, ambitions, or dreams besides wanting to be with Edward, who could kill her.<br /><br />Edward's element of danger is occasionally compelling, but it's totally overshadowed by the fact that Bella is completely oblivious to it. She doesn't fear him at all, and that doesn't come off like love: once again, it comes off as total stupidity.<br /><br />Edward. What can I say about Edward. There is nothing lovable about him except that he is apparently the most beautiful thing in existence. He's selfish: he stays near Bella when he knows he could lose control and kill her at any second. He's a creepy stalker: he watches her while she sleeps, before she even really knows him. He's volatile: his mood swings are insane and ridiculous. He's immature: for someone who's been alive for a hundred years, he doesn't seem to have gained much experience. He's controlling: he doesn't want to let her out of his sight for two seconds. (Granted, she's dumb enough to get herself killed if he does.) He's insulting: he treats Bella like an incapable, silly little girl. (Which he's right to, but I digress. It's still insulting.)<br /><br />I understand that Bella's smell and that Bella herself are irresistible to him. But if he wanted the best for her, he'd stay away from her, period, the end. The story is stupid, the love story is bad, and if that's what Stephenie Meyer is preaching to teenage girls, I think it's pretty questionable. It's not just \"a fun read\". There are girls out there who want to be Bella and who want to find an Edward.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />I think I might enjoy the story a lot more if Bella's head was not the one I had to spend time in while reading it. If I had to read one more description of how beautiful Edward is, I was going to choke a kitten. If it had focused more on the vampire family I would have been a lot more willing to forgive its faults. I thought Carlisle's and Alice's stories were really compelling, and Edward was finally accessible to me when he talked about Carlisle turning him into a vampire and how his family came to be formed, his life before Bella, etc. Some aspects of the vampirism were truly awesome: I found the idea that vampires can never sleep completely terrifying. That they never, ever get a break and never, ever get to rest... that is a wonderful and ghastly idea.<br /><br />Entirely overshadowed by their flowery breath and the fact that they <i>sparkle.</i> Mothereffing ridiculous.<br /><br />This is hardly the tip of the iceberg, but I'm trying to spare you at least a little.",

    "text": "It turns out we don't need Dr. John Gray to tell us that men are from Transylvania and women are from Venus. We just need to read Stephenie Meyer books. For example, from this book we learn that the millions of women who have wolfed down the Twilight series (pun intended) want men who:<br /><br /><b>1. Talk about their feelings.</b> Either Meyer's husband is the single-most communicative male on the planet and she doesn't realize how unusual he is, or she, like most of her female readers, is using her fiction to imagine a world where men not only have deep emotions but want to admit to having them and talk about them over and over, articulating even the most subtle of their internal dramas. <br /><br /><b>2. Make them flutter.</b> But just being a sensitive new-age kind of guy doesn't cut it. A man has to be hard-bodied, chiseled, dashing, and have eyes that pierce the soul, if not the skin (even as they never look at your chest). This book suggests that a real man makes you constantly stumble over your words, bite your lip to refrain from exclaiming adulations, and lose yourself in the sweet smell of his breath. <br /><br /><b>3. Are fiercely devoted.</b> That a girl of no spectacular beauty, who lacks any trace of conversation skills -- whose only virtue is that she smells really yummy -- can inspire an immortal creature of godlike power and grace to alter his entire existence to serve and protect her, watching over her by night (more on that in #4). This is a woman's ultimate fantasy -- to have the perfect man, perfectly devoted, for no good reason at all.<br /><br /><b>4. Want them so bad that they won't take them.</b> This, alas, is the most transparent aspect of this book's appeal. It speaks volumes about the differences between men and women to have so many women toss their bodice-ripping romances aside in order to read how a feral man with otherworldly physical desires can contain his passion and lust out of his pure and perfect love for his beloved. It says that women really do wish they could have it both ways, to be an object of lust and devotion at once, to fulfill a man's desire without actually slaking his thirst for her. To have a man watch you sleep and not want to have even a little peek under the covers -- now that's hot fantasy for today's woman who is otherwise told on a regular basis that to be her best self she has to enage in casual and risky sexual behavior. <br /><br />To see just what an indulgent fantasy this book is, just imagine the male-centric version of Twilight, in which a troubled teen boy moves to a small town to find the hottest girl in town is a vampiress. Such a book would be about 100 pages long (all the unnecessary internal dialogue would be removed). No one would talk except to comment on the awesome size of, um, one's videogame library. The vampiress would be simple: relatively dumb, incredibly hot, wearing almost nothing, and with no expectations of her man but drawn to him only by the smell of his gym bag. She wouldn't hold herself back from trying to bite her intended, but would get so distracted with his bedroom technique that she would never get around to it. <br /><br />We would laugh at such a book (in fact, we know it would never be a book since men don't read; it would be a movie, and it would be a smash summer hit called American Vam-Pie-er, I'll start the screenplay right away). Somehow, when this story is told in a similarly indulgent female-centric vein, we don't reject it, but sympathize with it. I believe this is because women get to indulge in their fantasies so rarely outside of Jane Austen novels while men are surrounded with theirs. So far I have yet see spam email inviting one to \"read hot things devoted husbands would say to their wives\" or \"see pictures of hunks promising not to get nasty out of respect for their women\" or \"buy this purple pill so you can stay up late and share your feelings -- seven times in one night!.\" So hats off to Stephenie Meyer for figuring out what it is that women really want and giving it to them. <br />",

    "text": "I really enjoy lively details. There's nothing better than knowing an author has really <i>thought</i> about her characters and situations, and come up with some surprising and delightful detail that makes the whole reading experience fuller. <i>Lively</i> details, you understand -- <i>pointless</i> details are a nightmare to read. I don't need to know that Bella ate a granola bar for breakfast. I REALLY DON'T. (Notice that I remembered the granola bar. I think this is partly because I was fervently hoping it <i>would</i> have significance. Like, she would spectacularly choke on her oatmeal the next day and think, \"AH, I should have had a granola bar like yesterday!\")<br /><br />\"Show, don't tell\" is not the be-all-and-end-all of writing. There's a little thing called <i>summary narrative</i>. It's beautiful; it facilitates plot progression without having to follow your narrator through 24-fucking-hours of a day... and \"watch\" as she eats a fucking granola bar for breakfast.<br /><br />I've seen this novel accused of Mary Sue-ism and um, <i>yeah</i>, any character named Isabella Swan seems destined to be a Mary Sue. But honestly, I wouldn't begrudge a semi-autobiographical story if it actually had any of the realism of autobiography. All the high school/teenage stuff honestly made me boggle. Because... that's not what high school is like! That's not what <i>being seventeen</i> is like! <i>Twilight</i> reads like... well, it reads like a thirtysomething who has <i>no</i> recollection of being 17. Bella has all the emotional maturity of a 32-year-old and that's just not remotely believable. <br /><br />Meyer is not a bad writer. She has the ability to string words together. Unfortunately, she lacks any kind of flair. There was no original description; no truly evocative language. <i>Twilight</i> reads like Meyer has read a lot of mediocre novels and regurgitated the same kind of language onto the page. There is just nothing <i>exciting</i> to the language. The dialogue is awful: not only uninspiring and lacking in wit, but... it's all the same! There's no difference in speech patterns to the characters; no awareness of personal tics. The characterization is wafer-thin (see above, re: Mary Sue). The plotting is terrible: the novel trundles along at a slow pace for 250 pages and then Meyer seems to suddenly realize she needs a climax and the gears shift abruptly and the reader is caught up in a series of ridiculous contrivances that set up Meyer's final set-piece (which, by the way, I saw coming a mile away).<br /><br />This is such a profoundly antifeminist novel. And it's funny, because I think Meyer has no idea that it's antifeminist. I mean, she has a female heroine! A heroine who reads Austen and writes essays about misogyny in Shakespeare! Surely she's kicking butt for all womankind. Um... no. She cooks, she cleans, she looks after the man in her life! She needs male characters to protect her from the big, bad, scary world! She falls headfirst into a disturbingly dysfunctional relationship with a man 90 years her senior without the slightest amount of worry!<br /><br />Seriously. Bella/Edward. What's <i>that</i> all about? I don't get the attraction. He has her in his <i>thrall</i>. She is, let me quote, \"unconditionally and irrevocably\" in love with him -- and after, like, a week. o__O She's consumed by him; she's willing to sacrifice her life for him, and that's... romantic? I just think it's a bit sick, really. You know what I find romantic? Human warmth. Not sweeping, dramatic statements of everlasting and overarching love. Little, sweet moments of connection that ring true. That's something <i>Twilight</i>'s apparently epic love story is sorely lacking in. (Did I say Bella has the emotional maturity of a 32-year-old? Well, except when it comes to Edward. There she has the emotional maturity of a <i>dumb dog</i>.)",

    "text": "my name is bella. bella swan. here's what stephenie didn't tell you. it's super-duper-important.<br /><br />on the morning after it rained, it was rainy outside and i frowned at it being so rainy all the time. i chuckled to myself, darn weather! i stared at the rain outside, which is where they usually keep the rain. there was never any rain in phoenix. i love phoenix. i hate rain. <br /><br /><br />i tripped over a large air pocket on my bedroom floor and bashed my skull into the corner of my bookcase, which had three shelves and was faux wood veneer. after i applied cold compresses and stanched most of the bleeding, i drove to school, but they must have moved the school building across town. i chuckled to myself, darn school moving people!<br /><br /><br />after i drove around for a few hours looking for where they put the building, edward cullen pulled up alongside me in his shiny, silver volvo, which was silver and a saab, i think. his well-muscled chest was riding shotgun, wearing a blue-gray waffle knit long-sleeved t-shirt, relaxed fit jeans with contrast stitching in a lightly distressed wash, and an ivory-colored jacket made from the dyed skins of clubbed baby seals. he dressed very well, like someone who wears nice clothes.<br /><br /><br />his well-muscled chest waved to me like an old friend, but edward glowered at me from the driver's seat. his eyes were black. i think he came down with glaucoma.<br /><br /><br />even though he glared at me and gave me the finger, he smiled and told me to follow him to school. he knew where they kept it. i wonder how he found out. but just then, i nearly tripped over my gas pedal and fell through the windshield. i am so clumsy. when we got to school, edward's well-muscled chest walked me to english class. <br /><br /><br />\"try to be careful in there,\" the chest giggled while at the same time giving me a sinister sideward glance that made the blood in the veins under my skin in my body feel ice-cold.<br /><br /><br />\"haha,\" i giggled, tapping the chest on its rippling pectorals. \"very funny,\" i then said running my finger around his kennedy-half-dollar sized nipples. \"i'll try to be careful,\" i joked, alarmed at the unearthly chill emitted by his taut obliques.<br /><br /><br />everyone stared at us in the hallway, which was a long interior space allowing access to various doors. the students were wearing clothes and talking and carrying books. through the windows of the classroom which looked onto the out-of-doors, i could see the rain was still raining outside. then i tripped over my clitoris and fell into a galvanized steel av cart on casters. three people were seriously injured.<br /><br /><br />i chuckled and turn bright red. how embarrassing.<br /><br /><br />at the end of the school day edward cullen came to walk me to my car. his chest was nowhere to be seen. probably at banana republic or out hunting mountain lions again. i chuckled to myself, darn chest!<br /><br /><br />\"where's my car?\" i giggled after chuckling for a while.<br /><br /><br />\"don't you remember that you totaled it this morning when you drove into the orphan's hospital?\" he said. he was looking at me with his eyes. he gave me his ivory jacket to keep me dry from the rain, which is usually very wet. then he looked at me again, smiling with the right half of his mouth but frowning with the left half of his mouth and oddly expressionless in the middle part of his mouth.<br /><br /><br />\"you know,\" i said, falling over a parking bumper into a rack of bicycles, \"rain isn't the only thing there is that gets me wet.\"<br /><br /><br />\"let's just be friends,\" he hissed, arching an eyebrow, flexing his sinewy wrists, and flaring his beautiful muscular nostrils.<br /><br /><br />i realized then he might be a vampire. or really gay. or a really gay vampire. <br /><br /><br />i should have known. he had erasure cassettes in the car.<br /><br />",

    "text": "I actually had to give this book three separate reviews by three sides of my personality. My three-star rating is the median of the three:<br /><br /><i>Review 1, by My Inner Fifteen Year Old Girl (5 stars):</i><br />Bella is smart, funny, well-read, pretty and yet misunderstood by most of her peers (just like me). Then she meets a cool, hot guy who turns out to be a good vampire, and he can do really cool things, like run fast and stop cars with his hands, but he's still sweet and wonderful. It's ultimate wish-fulfillment fantasy -- what's not to like? Meyers can make your heart speed up with some of the tense, tortured \"we must be together/no, what if i hurt you\" pg-13 erotica.<br /><br /><i>Review 2, by My Fan of YA Lit (3 Stars):</i><br />Meyers can tell a pretty good story, when she lets herself actually tell it -- the book starts out well, and would have been a bit more interesting if I hadn't known he was a vampire all along. Then it slows down during the long \"getting to know you\" dialogue exchanges between Edward and Bella -- there's no plot, just back-story and exposition disguised as conversations, and far too many \"I can't be with you, I don't want to hurt you!\" \"But I love you, I don't care about danger!\" back-and-forths. When the evil vamps show up, however, the story kicks back in and the end is quite exciting. When Meyers isn't dwelling on how perfectly angelic Edward is (again!) she can get the pages turning. Since there are A LOT of pages to turn, I wish she would have infused that urgency into the story more often. While abandoning most of the conventional cliches of vampire-lore (stakes, sunlight, garlic, coffins) she keeps all the modern-vamp-romance cliches (alabaster skin, good hair, expensive taste in clothes, tragically distant), and adds a few of her own unfortunate twists (vampires avoid the sun because it makes them sparkle, the good-vamp clan play some extreme version of baseball in a scene that was far too Quidich-y for my taste). Too many cliches or trying to hard to be original -- somehow both criticisms are accurate.<br /><br /><i>Review 3, by My Inner Feminist (1 Star):</i><br />Meyers describes Bella as being strong, brave, and independent, but then shows her as a spineless, cowering victim who needs to be saved by her violently jealous and over-protective boyfriend. She constantly goes on and on about how Edward is perfect at everything and how he's so gorgeous and she is so unworthy of him, how he's so strong and he protects her. In fact, she never gives any reason for liking him other than how hot he is, but that's fair because Edward never gives a reason for liking her other than she smells good. He is frustrated that Bella is the only person whose thoughts he can't read, so he eavesdrops on her friends minds to find out what they talk about, he follows her whenever she leaves her house, and he secretly camps outside her room when she sleeps - that doesn't sound sweet, it sounds creepy. If girls want a romantic, conflicted vampire/human romance, they should go watch the firs three seasons of Buffy -- not only is there the dark, mysterious, conflicted vampire, but the girl he's in love with can kick some serious ass all on her own.",

    "text": "Let me give you an idea of how much my opinion of this book changed at different stages of reading. When I was about a third of the way through, I was so into it that I immediately put my name on the library reservations list for the sequel, and wishlisted every edition on BookMooch. Now, having finished, I doubt I'll bother to read any further in the series. The opening is really quite interesting: Bella moves from sunny Arizona to rainy, gloomy Washington State to live with her father (her somewhat loopy mom wants to follow her new husband while he's <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road\" title=\"The Road by Cormac McCarthy\" rel=\"noopener\">on the road</a> as a minor league ballplayer). To her surprise, she gains almost instant popularity at her new high school\u2014with the exception of the beautiful Edward Cullen and his siblings, who either ignore her, or in the case of Edward himself, seem to be repulsed by her. Even though the reader probably knows going in that at least part of what's going on relates to Edward being a vampire (because it says in BIG LETTERS ON THE BACK that Edward is a vampire), it's still fun to speculate about what <i>exactly</i> is going on\u2014why does Edward seem both drawn and repelled by Bella? Why does he save her life? What are a bunch of vampires doing impersonating students at a small town high school, anyway?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the answers to all these questions seem to be either nonexistent or extremely lame. Edward reacts weirdly to Bella because she 1) smells unusually good, and 2) is the only person he's ever met whose mind he cannot read. No. 1 apparently makes him fall in love with her, while the reasons behind No. 2 are never explained. But, you know, the <i>actual</i> mysterious stuff is apparently not important\u2014instead it's more important that we realize that the Cullens are <i>good</i> vampires, who only eat animals, and who do nice, all-American things like play baseball in the woods. Okay! Also, all the weaknesses you've heard vampires have are just myths. Garlic, stakes, even sunlight\u2014no problemo. Yet Edward would never even consider turning Bella, because that would make her an Evil Thing. Oh, and they also can't have sex, presumably because Meyer once read \"Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex\" (and/or is a Mormon. Sorry).<br /><br />Instead, what Edward and Bella apparently CAN do is be very emo and teenage about their twu luv (despite Edward actually being over 100 years old), and be threatened by a villain that shows up in the novel's last third just to give it some semblance of an actual plot. Then, once all is well, they go to the prom! SERIOUSLY. THE BOOK ENDS WITH EDWARD TAKING BELLA TO THE PROM. What. The. Fuck.<br /><br />And still, none of this answers my number one question: if you were a century-old vampire, why the HELL would you spend your time going to high school in Washington State? (Especially when you're not even trying to bang high school girls.) Angel at his most pathetic emo mopiness had more spine.",

Before we continue, let's briefly racap <i>Part I of the VCT</i>. Your score in <u>Part I</u> should have given you a good idea of how critically you judge vampire fiction, placing you in either \"Group A\" or \"Group B\" based on overall points scored. <br><br><b><u>Group A</u>:</b> <br><br>A fairly harsh to extremely harsh critic that requires in a vampire story that it be: (a) well written or at least highly engaging prose; (b) tightly plotted with a well defined backstory that is either tied to an established \u201cvampire mythos\u201d or adds something substantial to the vampire genre; and (c) an intelligent, compelling original story or a slick, fast-paced, chill-filled thrill ride. <br><br><b><u>Group B</u>:</b> <br><br>Includes those that are not too critical and are generally okay as long as the writing and plot are not horrible and there is \u201csomething about it\u201d that makes it an interesting diversion. This group also includes those that are not sure what the word critic means. <br><br>So with Part I completed, we now turn to Part II of the VCT test. In this section, we will take a look at the most popular vampire series in publishing history (i.e., the Twilight series) and help you determine whether it is a good choice for your next reading selection**. <br><br>**(<b><u>PLEASE NOTE</u>: If you are part of \"Group A\" above than the answer is clearly <u>NO</u>, and you can move on immediately to Part III of the VCT.</b>) <br><br>For those in Group B, here are the instructions for this section of the VCT. For each of the 4 questions below, select the answer that best describes your personal taste when it comes to vampire fiction. Each answer has a corresponding point value that will be added up at the end of the test. The total number of points will indicate a preference for a certain kind of vampire novel, which can then be used to assist you in selecting the right story for you. <br>\u00a0<br><b><u>QUESTION 1</u>:</b> <i>Which of the following best describes your favorite kind of vampire?</i><br>\u00a0<br>A: Sparkly, epically EMO and unable to look threatening without legal counsel and a tactical nuke; <u>0 points</u><br>\u00a0<br>B: Underwear model hotness with perfect hair who smells like the beach and has eyes that can cause a person\u2019s naughty bits to spontaneously combust. <u>5 points</u><br>\u00a0<br>C: Chalky skin, \u201csuper cuts\u201d hair, stylistically challenged clothing (with or without Liberace cape) with long nails, ivory fangs and a kick ass accent. <u>10 points</u> \u00a0\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>D.

    "text": "<b>Call me crazy, but <i>Twilight</i> wasn't that bad.</b> Well, sure, it's bad, but it's not 1-star bad. The sequels were atrocious, sure, but the first book wasn't the worst crap I've ever read. <br /><br />What I suspect most of us hate about <i>Twilight</i> isn't the book itself, but the legion of rabid, terrifying fangirls. The ones debating on online forums about Team Edward vs. Team Jacob. The ones who will argue that <i>Twilight</i> is the best book ever written. The ones who camp out at <i>Twilight</i> movie premieres 1 month before opening day. The ones who post YouTube videos of themselves sobbing their heart out when Rpattz and Kstew broke up irl. <br /><br /><b>I hate the fans. I desperately hate the rabid fangirlzzz. There aren't enough words to describe my loathing of Twitards. The book itself wasn't that bad. </b><br /><br />I've read far worse before. I will read far worse in the future. I've read books that I wish were paper so that I could fling it across the room during a fit of rage. <br /><br />I've read books with alpha-douches who have made me use curse words that have made a Navy sailor blush. I've read books where the love interest is as abusive asshole who would think nothing of commenting on his love interest's tits or weight. And these books aren't even new adult. <br /><br />I've read books where the main character is a rampant fellow-girl hater and slut shamer. I've read books where the main character is so fucking dumb it makes my teeth hurts. I've read books where the main character seems to be doing her damnedest to remove herself from the human gene pool and it is only by the grace of <i>deus ex</i> fucking <i>machina</i> that she is saved. <br /><br />I've read books whose plot makes <i>Game of Thrones</i> seem simple, and not in the <b>\"Wow, that's really complex\"</b> kind of way as it is <b>\"What the actual <i>fuck</i> were you smoking when you wrote this?\"</b> kind of way. <br /><br />So in that sense, <i>Twilight</i> is really not that bad. Sure, Bella is dumb and a Mary Sue, but the worst you can say about her is that she is completely colorless and bland, with the personality of a block of tofu. The worst you can say about Edward is that he's a weirdo stalker who likes really young girls despite his age, but man, watching a girl while she sleeps? He's been out-creeped by far worse men. <br /><br />So really. I mean it. You may hate <i>Twilight</i> with my blessing, but please don't believe it's the worst example of YA literature out there. Is isn't, by any stretch of the imagination. ",

OMFG SRSLY stephenie, you can't afford a copy editor?? and while we are at it - your name is also a typo. and there is so much chuckling and tooth grinding and fist balling (heh) and jaw clenching it seems like a ticcy nicolas cage movie at times. and the repetition of words for edward; \"beautiful\" and \"heavenly\" and \"sublime\" and \"perfect\" \"perfect\" \"perfect\". christmas wishlist: a thesaurus for stephenie.<br><br>but more than that.<br><br>from what i had heard - the big complaint about this book was bella. i was expecting some vapid, swoony, clumsy, clingy, weak little thing who was a terrible role model for the young misses and a blight upon the face of womynhood. but she is actually pretty badass. she drives a massive truck and is good at science and likes to read and hates the prom and is pretty fearless and would hook a finger in your eye and pop it out instead of running away if she felt threatened. i can get behind that. <br><br>so what are the complaints <i>actually</i> about?? her selfless devotion to edward; her willingness to sacrifice and surrender herself for a boy. a vampire. a much older man. a creature known for its powers of mesmerism and allure.<br><br>the ultimate bad boy.<br><br>well, duh! <br><br>this is <b>precisely</b> how it feels to be a 17-year-old girl deeply in love. it's fight, kill, or die for your beloved. see, i <i>was</i> one, so i can speak to the phenomenon firsthand. and from here on out, if it makes you feel more comfortable; if you have a problem with sweeping generalities, when i use the phrase \"17-year-old-girl\", feel free to substitute \"karen t. brissette\"<br><br>17-year-old girls are drawn to the bad boy<br><br>17-year-old girls in love do not think, they feel<br><br>17-year-old girls are dangerously self-absorbed (when \"self\" includes the beloved because they are one soul etc etc) <br><br>17-year-old girls do not give one shit about what kind of example they are setting for others of their gender<br><br>17-year-old girls are all too inclined to sacrifice,to become a martyr for their love, to believe in the magic of the world and the power of infatuation, and to risk it all to prolong that infatuation<br><br>17-year-old girls lack cynicism and have no real frame of reference yet or any extensive battle scars, or relationship track record; everything is here and now and the most important thing in the history of the world.<br><br>so, yeah, bella, i get you. you are not a victim. and your clumsiness (and mine) are very endearing.as is your commitment. i once walked miles barefoot on the summer blacktop to show my devotion to mine, he pulled equally stupid demonstrative stunts - there were blowups and reconciliations and third-party interventions and i <i>became</i> love and it was wonderful, mercurial, mad mad mad.<br><br>so,yeah, bells, i get your depth of feeling.<br><br>forget team edward<br>forget team jacob<br>i am resoundingly team bella.<br><br>and i was also told this was one of the most erotic novels of all time, by my most favorite professor, and i rolled my eyes at the time, thinking \"why does everyone like this damn book so much??\"but you know what?? she was right. this is totally virgin porn. straight up sweaty virgin porn.<br><br>and of course, <i>all</i> vampire lit is porn, where the bloodsucking stands in for the sex act etc etc. but what if both parties are acting against nature/their inclinations?<br><br>he is repressing his desire to drink her blood<br><br>she is repressing her desire to touch him<br><br>both feel the strain of resistance and every time they are close - there is amazing heightened tension.and it is - it is pretty damn hot.<br><br>hoofa.<br><br><br>so, yeah, like cottage cheese, i have come around in my thinking about this book. but i refuse to give this a star rating. let me hold on to that much of my pride.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1528725630i/25720315.png\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><a href=\"http://bloggycomelately.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">come to my blog!</a>",

But I think our judgement has been clouded for the past ten to twelve years - at least mine has, by the endless slew of stale \u201cstill a better love story\u201d memes and the constant personal jabs aimed at Stephenie Meyer by mainstream media. There\u2019s also the YA scene\u2019s insidious desire to erase all memory of it from genre history: when I was doing research for this review, I found\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxioQQqWLSY&amp;t=4s\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this video</a>\u00a0in which multiple YA authors explain what their influences were for writing female-centric YA stories, and not one of them mentions <i>Twilight</i>, which\u2026 Whoa. Like, that\u2019s astounding to me. It's just disingenuous as fuck, that they had the <b>gall</b> to brazenly omit Stephenie Meyer from their credit lines, particularly when one or more of them started their careers in paranormal YA on the tail of the <i>Twilight</i> boom. Even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkdnKQmHsWA\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this video</a>, which claims to illustrate the history of\u00a0YA, downplays <i>Twilight's</i>\u00a0influence on the genre.\u00a0<br><br>YA existed before <i>Twilight</i>, of course, but it baffles me when the YA industry now slaps its hands to its ears and la-la-las over the indisputable truth: YA was a marginalised genre before the <i>Twilight</i> phenomenon. Was it a coincidence that YA paranormal romance exploded upon the rising popularity of <i>Twilight</i>? You could argue that it was, of course, and you\u2019re entitled to your wrong opinion, but I did not unironically Google \u201cEdward Cullen star sign\u201d for you hoes to come at me with \u201cwhat about <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>\u201d. Fuck <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>. I\u2019m not explaining that opinion any further and not will I defend it. Fuck that book and fuck all of its smug knock-offs, because if you polish a turd it\u2019s still a turd. I'm sorry, but I don't make the rules. <br>\u00a0<br>The basic breakdown is this: I enjoyed this book, and I mean I genuinely enjoyed it, and was invested, until about the halfway mark. After that, it was impossible for me to ignore the cloying creepiness that perverts a sweet and tender love story into something that, as an adult, is difficult for me to justify. When I was 13, I was a stan for <i>Twilight</i>, but not because of the books - I had only seen the movies, and for this reason it feels like a missed opportunity, because I can\u2019t accurately compare my feelings then to my feelings now. This inaccuracy stems mostly from the fact that the movies were a <b>farce</b> that in no way capture the spirit of the characters or any of the relationships between them. It\u2019s because of the movies that this series is the focus of such intense ridicule and hatred in the media; it\u2019s the self-seriousness of the movies that\u2019s so infuriating, because while the book is melodramatic and depressing, it\u2019s light and jubilant where the movie isn\u2019t. My main problem with the media\u2019s perception of the series is that it\u2019s based entirely on this self-seriousness, and in particular Kristen Stewart\u2019s dead eyes. <br><br>The truth is that Book Bella and Movie Bella are two starkly different people, and you can fucking fight me on this. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that Stephenie Meyer is <a href=\"https://variety.com/2013/film/news/stephenie-meyer-on-twilight-i-am-so-over-it-1200577245/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">over it</a> and has Moved On,\u00a0because if I was her, I would genuinely be bitter as fuck, the most poisonous bitch, an actual\u00a0Vi\u1e63akany\u0101, not only for the unstoppable barrage of media abuse but also for the forced image of my creative work as something completely separate from what it is.\u00a0<br><br>Meyer has weathered a barrage of criticism for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/11/stephenie-meyer-twilight-the-host\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Mormon lifestyle</a>, and this has bled into her storytelling, and to an extent I agree, because heavy-handed morality is an easy way to drop a story down a U-bend. However, while Meyer\u2019s inherent religious biases have centred heteronormativity and gender-based parameters, it may run deeper than this. The artery of conflict that threads through each book in the series is opposing ideals within the central relationship, and if we look at these characters as theological models, their connection does boast a bit more nuance: Edward is Mormonism and Bella is modernism, thus their relationship is a wrestle between starkly defined historical values and modern flexibility.\u00a0<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1537555408i/26334536._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"490\" height=\"260\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>To explore this model, it's worth analysing each character as an individual, not both as a unit (we'll get to that later). My impression of Bella is that she's confident in familiar situations and, contrary to common criticism, mostly generated from the appallingly weak and lifeless character in the movies, is not defined by low self-esteem. When several boys ask her out to the dance she never defaults to this modest cry of, \u201cwho, me?\u201d; she\u2019s weary of the attention, and shrugs off her pursuers by diverting their romantic efforts to her single friends (with whom she shares close, if superficial bonds, to be expected from people who haven't had much time to get to know each other outside of school). She never shrinks away from male attention, and while she does often acknowledge that Edward is aesthetically pleasing, her reaction to being seen with a \"dazzling\" and notorious man is a natural one: \u201cWon\u2019t people wonder why someone so special is out with someone so ordinary, like me?\u201d This is not a new or particularly groundbreaking question to ask oneself, especially in young and emotionally charged relationships, and especially with someone like Bella, who is defined by her low-key and utilitarian outlook, and her discomfort with an excess of attention in social circles.\u00a0<br><br>Bella mentions that she was not popular in Arizona, but for defined reasons: She is not sporty or excessively outgoing, which the book lays out as defining traits of most Arizonans (as a non-American, I\u2019m unable to confirm this as truth or condemn it as a false stereotype, but the author does live in Arizona). She also states that her last school was densely populated which, naturally, provides an ease of anonymity. Her move to Forks batters her with the scrutiny of the tight-knit community, due for the most part to her mother\u2019s vaguely sordid reputation as \u201cthe Chief\u2019s flighty ex-wife\u201d (12), the Chief being Charlie, a trusted pillar of the community. Ren\u00e9e\u2019s notoriety as an ex-Forks resident, an elusive outsider who left the town in her dust - an uncommon novelty - marks her as a kind of traitor to the community, and by extension, Bella shares this burden. Even without considering her mother\u2019s impact on Forks\u2019 social circle, Bella invites attention as a rare new face among a close circle of scandal-starved teens.\u00a0<br><br>Again and again, Bella is verbally lashed for a lack of personality or strong voice, but while Bella\u2019s narration is introspective, this doesn\u2019t strip her of personality (I mean it; this criticism is repeated ad nauseam). She\u2019s a quiet, orderly girl who respects authority and values her studies, as much a clich\u00e9 of its time as the \u201cstrong female protagonist\u201d that has haunted YA for the past six years and has launched an oftentimes distasteful attack on traditional femininity, creating a dichotomy between \u201cstrong girl\u201d and \u201cweak girl\". <br><br>But Bella can\u2019t be neatly categorized with her knock-offs: she forfeited her happy, sunny life in Arizona for her mother\u2019s benefit, a notably selfless choice, and not a courtesy that her mother necessarily deserves. Ren\u00e9e's neglectful parenting is often brushed aside as she hounds Bella via email and phone, creating an unsavoury illusion of parental concern. In reality, Ren\u00e9e is immature and self-involved, leaving bills unpaid and the fridge bare, darting off to pursue an unsustainable life on the road while she has a dependent minor at home. This is commented on in a particularly telling passage wherein Bella is concerned about leaving her \u201cerratic, harebrained mother\u201d (4) to fend for herself: \u201cOf course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost\u201d (4). It's a troubling role reversal that plays out in a similar, albeit softer, fashion when Bella moves in with her father and is immediately forced to take on basic duties in the home, due to her father\u2019s ineptitude in the kitchen and in homemaking.\u00a0<br><br>But Bella is an independent girl who doesn\u2019t want to shoehorn her mother into the same situation that she fled in Forks, so she moves away to stay with her father purely for Ren\u00e9e\u2019s benefit. But her relationship with Charlie is tender: when Tyler\u2019s truck nearly crushes her, she\u2019s thinking fondly of her father, who got up early to put snow chains on the wheels of her truck. It\u2019s the same sort of quiet thoughtfulness that defines Bella. When people like Jacob and Angela are being sidelined by their friends - ignored during a group conversation - Bella notices this and acknowledges them. Bella\u2019s personality is quiet, but I wouldn't call it weak. (It's worth remembering that, in 2005, a \"ladylike front\" was very much in fashion and not only in religious circles like Meyer's. This \"touch my butt and buy me pizza\" attitude didn't come into fashion until Tumblr became mainstream, and until the internet popularised the Anna Kendrick brand. You know, this \"I'm a gross girl and I wear sweatpants and I like to swear\". That mentality wasn't part of the media hive mind yet.)<br><br>Is this what catches Edward\u2019s attention? In part, yes. Though more prominently it\u2019s Bella\u2019s <b>mystery</b> that attracts Edward. He can\u2019t read her mind, thus their courtship requires rituals, wooing, a thrill that is missing entirely from Edward\u2019s life. I mentioned in my status updates that I had a lot of feelings about Edward, his past and his pain, and to an extent I do; it\u2019s another missed opportunity, because Edward\u2019s past is handwaved, even though it influences every facet of his questionable behaviour, from his total lack of awareness about road safety, to his absurd and oftentimes bewildering fascination with Bella\u2019s average life.\u00a0<br><br>Here\u2019s the thing about Edward: he\u2019s either too old or too young, depending on how you look at it. He was born on the cusp of living memory, which means that in 2005, he\u2019s the same age as some people\u2019s great grandparents, and this is what makes his relationship with Bella unacceptable. He\u2019s not a relic, like Carlisle, or merely an older man. He is geriatric, and this adds an element of unavoidable perversion to his romance with a teenage girl.\u00a0With a clear mind, it\u2019s almost impossible not to recoil when Edward describes Bella as \u201cappallingly luscious\u201d or during this exchange: <br><br>\u201c\u2018That\u2019s probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.\u2019<br>I brindled a little at the word <i>child</i>. \u2018Jacob is not that much younger than I am,\u2019 I reminded him.<br>He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. \u2018Oh, I know,\u2019 he assured me with a grin.\u201d (305)<br><br>If we look at this from Carlisle\u2019s point of view, then it becomes apparent that Edward\u2019s age was a huge narrative blunder. Carlisle is 362, and if we sit back and contemplate the enormity of that, and the sheer gulf between him and someone who is seventeen, then it almost wouldn\u2019t be so bad if Edward were also old as balls: he could be considered something other entirely, not an elderly man but a creature from another world, wholly divorced from Bella\u2019s insular world. It would be as if she had fallen in love with an alien, or some eldritch beast from a parallel universe. It would require a lot more effort on Meyer's part to explain exactly what it is that makes their relationship hold together, and the politics between them would be more complex, but this would arguably have made for a more cerebral read. (Conversely, this is why I struggle to fully get on board with <i>Outlander</i>. Granted, I've only seen the TV show, but how could Claire and Jamie possibly find anything to talk about that's remotely relevant to either of their lives? He's never seen a bean can and he doesn't know what the telly is.) But ageing Edward up could, with some moral gymnastics and a constant reminder that Yes, This Is Weird, But We\u2019re Going With It, remove him from Bella\u2019s socio-political sphere just enough that it would almost be more acceptable.<br><br>It's the poor decision to time Edward's birth at the beginning of the 20th century that really hits the nail into the coffin here. While it does comfortably serve the theological dichotomy between Edward and Bella (anyone significantly older would probably not be Mormon, as Mormonism wasn't a thing until the early-to-mid 1800s) it is a stumbling block for the believability of the romance. The movie and the book both struggle desperately to reconcile Edward\u2019s point of view with Bella\u2019s, neither one with enough sleight of hand to properly explore the intricacies of it; that said, at least in the book, Edward is <i>fun</i>:<br><br>\u201c\u2018You scared me for a minute there,\u2019 [Edward] admitted after a pause\u2026 \u2018I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.\u2019<br>\u2018Ha, ha.\u2019 I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute. <br>\u2018Honestly\u2014I\u2019ve seen corpses with better colour. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.\u2019<br>\u2018Poor Mike. I bet he\u2019s mad.\u2019<br>\u2018He absolutely loathes me,\u2019 Edward said cheerfully.\u201d (85)<br><br>In the movie, it\u2019s impossible to understand why the hell this old man is chasing after this little girl, but in the book he\u2019s charming and eloquent, and there are instances that beget genuine empathy\u2014I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Edward\u2019s total disregard for his own personal safety, his exclusion from society, this insular environment that Carlisle\u2019s bite condemned him to. He is an old man caged in the body of a teenager, and his family only enables his self-destructive behaviour. I wouldn\u2019t even call him a pervert: I would call him someone who is so psychologically damaged from a physical assault that he is clawing desperately to human affection to try to manufacture a sense of normalcy in his life. And Carlisle, his attacker, is now his sole benefactor, the puppeteer of a collection of ageless marionettes that obey his authority over their household. They survive at Carlisle\u2019s pleasure; they play by his rules. But Edward states that the vampires do not sleep, and while sleep is necessary for growth and repair, it\u2019s also vital for mental health. What has this created in Carlisle, a man who hasn\u2019t <i>slept</i> in around 340 years? Is there any way to measure the psychological damage this could cause, or are we seeing it now in this strange, macabre puppet show that is the Cullen clan?<br><br>Is this an intentional angle? It\u2019s hard to say. I doubt it, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as \u201creading too much\u201d into stories, especially those that deal with extremely weighty topics such as immortality and love and pack mentality. What strikes me most here is that Bella is a victim of the Cullen clan, but so is Edward, and of course Rosalie. Edward, Rosalie, and Esme were all turned by Carlisle without their consent, and while they all were dying, and though this is passed off as noble by Carlisle, it doesn\u2019t ring true.\u00a0<br><br>As asserted by the narrative, the \u201clawless\u201d vampires, i.e. those who do not belong to a \"safe\" clan and who are not under the control of any other entity, and who hunt humans, are the villains of this story, but what makes them villainous is their disregard for human life, and that they justify this by citing their natural instincts. The vampires\u2019 natural attractiveness, their smell, and their heightened senses all function for ease of hunting, and the Cullens are not exempt; the difference between them is that the ungoverned vampires hunt humans, and the Cullens do not.\u00a0<br><br>Or do they?<br><br>Perhaps what Carlisle did can\u2019t be labelled \u201chunting\u201d, but it could be something worse. It could be the ultimate act of power and control, to stockpile living bodies, to use acts of brutality and violence to manufacture close familial bonds. Carlisle professes not to have given in to his baser instincts, but the truth may be that he did, not by killing but with a cultivated community of psychological torture. Edward states that Carlisle was lonely, but the problematic element to this is that Carlisle knew <b>why</b> he was lonely - it was because immortality made him that way. His solution to this was to condemn other people to the same fate. One could ask why Carlisle was so certain that the other \u201cCullens\u201d would bond with him, but my answer to this is that Carlisle made it that way: this was his design, to collect a trove of ghosts and lock them behind the doors of his estate. <br><br>The Cullens will always be connected by the things that make them \u201cother\u201d, and in the end, so will Bella. She will become a Cullen too, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s not Edward\u2019s fingers that are plucking her puppet strings.\u00a0<br><br>Is James the villain here? Perhaps. Perhaps not.\u00a0<br><br><br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1537560455i/26334733._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"490\" height=\"260\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1537560505i/26334735._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"490\" height=\"260\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><i>This is a new prototype for my review layout and I'm hoping to create more graphics/interactive content in the future.

Meyer also stands accused of exploiting Quileute culture, and moreover I'm annoyed about the author's racism, which showed when she blocked the director of the first film from casting anyone who wasn't white for the Cullens. So you know, there's all that.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kaispellmeier/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Find more of my books on Instagram</a>",

    "text": "Twilight is lame and stupid.<br /><br />I think everyone knows that the characters are essentially the ones who make up the book. It\u2019s through them that the plot is developed, the conflicts are carried, the climax is revealed, stuff like that. And when you\u2019re writing in a first person POV, you have to make that \u201cfirst person\u201d interesting and observant. Bella, our first person, is about as interesting as a rock. <br /><br />Isabella is nothing more than a Mary Sue. It doesn\u2019t even take a genius to figure out that \u2018Bella\u2019 is Italian for \u2018beautiful\u2019. And her last name is \u2018Swan\u2019, which as a device in literature, symbolizes grace and beauty. Bella Swan? Beautiful Swan? Not very clever.<br /><br />Here\u2019s the contradiction: She\u2019s ordinary. At least that\u2019s what she keeps on insisting throughout the book. Practically everyone in her new school asks her to the dance, or to the prom. And she gets the guy who apparently \u201cdoesn\u2019t date\u201d because \u201cnone of the girls\u2026 are good-looking enough for him.\u201d Her appearance is somewhat similar to the author\u2019s, as well as her story of moving to a new place. If it helps, she\u2019s a klutz \u2013 a last ditching effort to not make her a complete Mary Sue.<br /><br />Most readers who like Twilight relate to Bella. Well I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t possibly relate to a young woman with no plans, no goals, no solid interests, no personality, no deep observations of life, no nothing - but is just \u201cunconditionally and irrevocably in love with\u201d her boyfriend. I really can\u2019t. There\u2019s something so shallow and pathetic about it; the way she\u2019s willing to throw away her friends and family for a guy she has been acquainted with for just\u2026 two weeks? Besides, she is extremely boring, the sort which makes you fall asleep while she talks. And if she\u2019s not obsessing over Edward, she does, well, nothing but whines, or tells him and his family that she doesn\u2019t want to be rescued.<br /><br />I would have liked it if Meyer had given her a little backbone and some brain cells, so she can get out of the stupid situations she puts her stupid self in. I don\u2019t buy her \u201cI grew up in Phoenix\u201d statement. Nobody who grew up in Phoenix would be an idiot enough to wander around empty streets of an unfamiliar city alone. Then again, her idiocy is necessary to give way to her savior, Edward Cullen.<br /><br />Edward is a vampire \u2013 oops! \u2013 a perfect vampire. He\u2019s the most beautiful thing which ever existed\u2026 Have I mentioned that he\u2019s perfect? And that he has topaz eyes? <br /><br />He\u2019s also bipolar. He\u2019s serious one time, and then laughs exuberantly another. Insane mood swings, I tell you. He\u2019s supposed to be your perfect male protagonist \u2013 hawt!!! (not hot; it should be hawt and must always be followed by three exclamation points), dangerous, smart, mysterious, perfect, and, uhm, sparkly (although the last adjective is not really required; it\u2019s just a bonus if you\u2019re lucky enough). He has this stalker-ish behavior, which is sick: He sneaks into Bella\u2019s room and watches her sleep before they even get to talk. Some think that it\u2019s romantic, but it\u2019s just creepy. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s so romantic about it. <br /><br />Edward is 100-something years old and lives with his vampire family. Apparently he and his family don\u2019t drink human blood, because they don\u2019t want to be completely evil. They\u2019re vegetarians: They only drink blood of animals. They are basically good vampires, and they also play baseball in the woods to pass the time. Also, every myth about vampire is WRONG! Stakes, garlic, sleeping in coffin (although the idea of not sleeping ever was okay) \u2013 even sunlight!<br /><br />But you know, age and race don\u2019t matter in this book, because Edward and Bella actually fall in love! As for the reason\u2026 what is the reason again? Oh, because Bella smells good and Edward is hawt!!!. They\u2019re made for each other! It\u2019s destiny! <br /><br />Seriously, though, the romance between them is forced and trite. And it\u2019s even more boring than they both are, because they have no personality whatsoever. I'm not even sure if there's romance at all. There is no development of feelings. Just\u2026 BAM! They\u2019re in love! They don\u2019t even do anything but talk about how in love they are. From there, everything becomes sheer selfishness, and for the nth time, stupidity. Bella\u2019s life revolves around her boyfriend, and nothing more. Not only is it absurd; it also gives horrible messages, namely:<br /><br />1. It\u2019s okay to fall in love in a matter of days and then risk your life for it.<br />2. You don\u2019t have to have dreams or goals or anything like that; just get a girl/boyfriend. It\u2019s far more important!<br />3. It\u2019s perfectly fine to lie to your parents especially when it concerns your girl/boyfriend.<br />4. Ditch your friends. Girl/Boyfriend first, I tell you! Girl/Boyfriend first!<br /><br />Considering the fact that Edward is so much older than Bella, shouldn\u2019t he be more rational? More mature? Knowing he can kill Bella, he should have just left her alone. And how come Edward just blabbers everything to Bella? You know, the vampire stuff? For someone who has been in this world for more than a hundred years, he sure displays the maturity of a fetus.<br /><br />And he\u2019s supposed to be dangerous. That could have worked, if only Bella had the wits to be actually scared. It\u2019s funny; that girl\u2019s so brainless you can\u2019t possibly scare her! As for Edward, it would have been better if he had shown how dangerous he could be. I don't know, maybe good vampires can only talk about how dangerous they area instead of actually showing it.<br /><br />Oh, how could I forget! Edward SPARKLES UNDER THE SUN! Did you know that? Isn\u2019t that cool? The coolest thing ever? It\u2019s like the most magnificent thing next to Edward! He sparkles \u201clike thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface\u201d of his skin! Sparkling! Glittering! Glistening! Scintillating! Oh! my! gosh! Meyer is so original! Who else could have thought that?!<br /><br />The plot is absolutely zero (the romance between Bella and Edward is not a plot). It\u2019s basically just \u201cHe\u2019s a vampire, she\u2019s not. They fall in love. End of story.\u201d And there were a lot of loopholes:<br /><br />1. Why would the Cullens want to study in high school?! This is my number one question. Hello? Who wants to go through high school over and over again??<br />2. Why would they want to blend in with the rest of humanity?<br />3. Why would they put themselves near humans when they know it\u2019s hard to resist biting them?<br />4. Why would one bad vampire like to bite Bella specifically?<br /><br />I\u2019d like to answer and expand on loophole 4, because it\u2019s absolutely preposterous. I didn\u2019t even care about that James vampire when he appeared, because his arrival was so cliched and so late. It\u2019s like Meyer suddenly remembered that there should be something climax-y in Twilight, just to give it a semblance of a plot. \"This James ought to do the trick. He should be the one to threaten Bella\u2019s life and then she makes an insanely silly mistake and she almost gets killed BUT Edward rescues her!\"<br /><br />Meyer\u2019s writing style isn\u2019t something to commend on either; she writes like a twelve-year old. She makes Dan Brown look like a Pulitzer Prize winner. Her words are stilted. The narration is unexciting, dragging, and redundant. Bella keeps telling the readers how much she hates the rain in the first 100 pages of the book, and how she can\u2019t dance. If not that, she repetitively says how perfect and beautiful Edward is. What\u2019s ironic is that despite all the perfect descriptions of him, I never quite pictured him in my mind. I\u2019m still wondering how the rest of humanity can drool and squeal at the thought of him.<br /><br />Bella glares all the time, too. Bella also grimaces a lot, and hisses, and stumbles. Glares, grimaces, hisses, stumbles. Four redundant freakin\u2019 verbs in a 500-page book. That\u2019s not so much, unless you can count only to three. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Edward always smiles his crooked smile, and he dazzles people (especially Bella).<br /><br />Nobody \u2018said\u2019 anything. Characters only \u2018gasped\u2019, \u2018chuckled\u2019, \u2018questioned\u2019, and \u2018answered\u2019. <br /><br />Meyer also occasionally uses ridiculously long AND obscure words, which don\u2019t quite fit since the rest of her words are plain and simple. I remember one: Ostentatious. She could have simply used \u2018showy\u2019 or \u2018flamboyant\u2019, but it just had to be ostentatious. Why she used that, I\u2019ve no idea. (In the next books, Meyer uses bigger words. I wonder how big they are\u2026)<br /><br />And you know, Meyer ends Twilight with Bella attending the PROM. That\u2019s how a vampire story should end: The heroine should attend the prom with her vampire boyfriend. In that ruffled gown and stiletto heels\u2026 It just makes sense (although it did take Bella about ten years to figure out Edward is taking her to the prom. What an idiot). Meyer skipped the almost action-y part (Emmett and Jasper\u2019s dealing with James) but she elaborates on the prom.<br /><br />Now that I\u2019ve finished reading and dissecting Twilight, I still don\u2019t understand all the hype it\u2019s getting. It reads like a bad fan fic. I won't stop you from reading it, though. That's a choice for you to make.",

    "text": "Ok... I know that I'm going to offend a lot of people with this review, but I feel that I have to be honest about this. There are quite a few things that bother me about this book, I will only list the top 5 here:<br /><br />1) Bella - She is the exact character that I do NOT want my daughters to have as a role model. She is a sighing, swooning, fainting, weeping, weak female character straight out of the 19 century. This is the 21st century people! Do we want to raise a generation of namby pamby young women who can't stand on their own two feet?<br /><br />2) Edward - This is the kind of guy that I warn my daughters to stay away from. The guy sneaks into her room and watches her sleep. Does anyone else see anything creepy about this? He's obsessed with rescuing her and he thinks that if he doesn't follow her around 24/7 that she'll get herself into a dangerous situation that she can't handle. Does anyone else see anything creepy about this?<br /><br />3) The relationship - This is a textbook case of co-dependency if I ever saw one. They hardly know each other, but suddenly they can't live without each other? The dialogue is like something straight out of a Harlequin - ugh! I think that young people have enough trouble knowing the difference between love and lust and this book does not help.<br /><br />4) Too much emphasis on appearances - It's like Edward's good looks are all that matters, personality is not important. Bella must be good looking too, why else would a 100 year old vampire be interested in a 17 year old girl? Her personality leaves much to be desired so we know it's not that.<br /><br />5) The comparison between this series and the Harry Potter series - If I were J.K. Rowling I would be offended that people are comparing the Twilight series with the Harry Potter series. Stephani Meyer's writing is NOT up to par with J.K. Rowling - not even close.<br /><br />The worst thing about this book is that it's so hugely popular. There are thousands of young girls all over the nation who are swooning over Edward and wishing that they could be \"just like Bella\" - gag! I truly think that this book is a detriment to society. There's a lot more I could say, but I think that I've offended enough people for now.",

    "text": "there are so many problems with this book that i can't even begin to address them all. but i will say this, 'twilight' is probably one of the worst, if not THE worst, books i've ever read. the writing is amateurish at best [cliches, stereotypes, purple prose--how anyone can applaud meyer's prose is puzzling]; the editing--or lack thereof--is appalling [this is a 200 page novel, no more and probably less]; the grammar and syntax are unforgivably bad; the plot is onion-skin thin; and the characters are uniformly dull and uninspiring. <br /><br />it's hard to imagine how so many people got suckered into this book. the novel's protagonist, bella swan [really? i mean, really?], is a complete idiot. she has no dreams, no motivations, no ambitions, no hopes, no goals, and not a single original thought of her own. she spends 500 pages spewing endless platitudes and commenting on edwards 'perfect face,' 'amber eyes,' and 'perfectly-muscled chest' ad nauseum [those references number in the HUNDREDS, literally]. she constantly wonders why edward, a 100-year old domineering vampire, wants her. apparently she's the only one who doesn't realize how 'beautiful' she is. too bad, so sad. honestly, this is the kind of novel you'd expect see selling for $1.99 at the supermarket checkout, not winning all sorts of awards. at one point i was half-expecting to close the book and find fabio on the cover. and a glittery vampire? gimme a break. <br /><br />frankly, i'm mystified at its popularity. if nothing else, i guess it goes to show what clever marketing and stories of wish-fulfillment and so-called 'forbidden love' can do to some women. it's made meyer a multi-millionaire, i'm sure, and turned her publisher into a cash cow. i don't begrudge anyone his or her success, but when it comes via a turd like 'twilight,' it's well, more than a tad saddening. <br /><br />'twlight' apologists will say that 'at least young women are reading!'i guess you could make that argument, but with that kind of logic you might as well congratulate an anorexic for eating a marshmallow.",

(more about that later).<br>365 dni is advertised as romance, when the romance aspect of it is questionable to say the least, the book portrays and supports a very toxic abusive relationship &amp; its scenes could be triggering to some readers (Note that no actual warning was given in the beginning of the book, maybe because the author doesn't realize or want to admit that what she's writing is actually rape/assault that's masquerading as 'steamy' consensual s*x).<br><br><br><u> A short summary: </u><br>Laura goes on vacation to Sicily with her boyfriend and 2 more friends for her 29th birthday. <br>Laura is content with her boyfriend Martin even though their relationship lacks the passion she wants &amp; she's the type of woman that loves sex.<br>A dealbreaker for Laura turns out to be Martin not paying her enough attention because he works too much, on her birthday she has had enough of it so she runs off angry and gets kidnapped.<br>Her kidnapper is the mafia Don Massimo Toricelli, who's been looking for the girl from his visions for years. He gives her 365 days to fall in love with him the catch here is she can't run off or he will kill her parents (not so romantic already).

She the type of heroine that would have one good breakthrough when it comes to her situation &amp; how the hero treats her only to then take 6000 steps back and throw away her backbone.<br>Throughout the book she has many conflicted thoughts, she would see that the hero is in the wrong only to excuse his shitty behaviour 5 seconds later to a point it felt like Stockholm Syndrome.<br>Something I want to mention: In my opinion (and based on what happens in the book) Laura is the author's <b> self insert </b>, here is why: Around the middle of the book the heroine's appearance changes out of the blue - she decides to change her hairstyle and hair color without any kind of explanation: a short blond bob, which is exactly how the author looks &amp; she even put herself on the cover of the second book about Massiomo and Laura.<br><br><b> Massimo <i> \"Consent-Is-Just-A-Word-I-Like-To-Say\" </i> Toricelli </b> - This guy is so far the most inlikable character I've ever encountered. I can't believe we're supposed to accept him as the hero of this book, considering how vile he is &amp; the fact he doesn't have any redeemable qualities.<br>We get to catch a glimpse of how effed up he is in Chapter 1 where he forces himself on a flight attendant.<br>Things to know about Massimo - he the type of guy that would blame the heroine for him not being able to control himself, the type that would go as far as killing the men that are interested in Laura, he loves to use the word consent but doesn't really respect it, words like 'NO' and 'Stop' mean nothing to him, he's a huge hypocrite (He has no problem getting advantage of tipsy Laura, but gets angry when her ex does that. He thinks is okay to drug another of Laura's exes so he can cheat but kills her ex because he drugs her. He justifies killing said ex because he has hurt her in the past while he was on drugs, when Massimo hurts her all the time and can't excuse his behaviour with being on drugs).<br>Massimo uses sex as an outlet for his dark &amp; psychopathic side, he takes pleasure in seeing fear in his partners eyes (including Laura's) &amp; almost killing them/them almost choking on his thick as a birthday candle c*ck (Laura's actual description of Little Massimo). Don't be fooled by what the actor that would be playing Massimo is saying about him seeing sex as art, he hasn't read the book.<br>What absolutely made me hate this character is what he did in Chapter 6 of the book: Laura as I already mentioned has a weak heart (she faints a lot in the book) &amp; also a fear of flying, so when she sees the size of his private jet, she panics &amp; says she doesn't want to get on, Massimo doesn't do what any other normal love interest would do (try to calm her down), instead he forcefully gets her on board, when she tries to leave he starts pushing her around while screaming at her, ties her hands with his belt and when she faints from all this stress he's not fazed at all.<br>When she wakes up again, he still demands for her to choose a punishment instead of apologizing for his behaviour and asking if she's okay.<br>Laura chooses a punishment, but he never actually does what she chose, instead forces himself on her despite having promised multiple times he would wait for her consent, what he does next I consider rape/assault.<br>Once they land he still doesn't care about her hurting, they go to a hotel where he ties her to bed against her will (she herself says she's terrified &amp; wants to get out of the room) &amp; forces her watch him get a blow job from an escort (he almost kills the other girl).<br>Another thing that crosses a line is Massimo putting a capsule in Laura's arm and lying that it's a contraceptive instead of a tracking device (his whole plan is to get her pregnant so she doesn't want to leave because of the child).<br><br>Some secondary characters: <br><br>Olga (Laura's bff) - Olga was a character that had potential, but turned out to be just like Laura, she would give Laura a good advice (like tell her that she's in a golden cage, but that's still a cage &amp; that her and Massimo has known each other just for 3 months and it's all maybe too rushed) only to get distracted by the fact that Massimo is rich and buys Laura things &amp; tell her friend she's lucky and to enjoy her life.<br><br>Domenico (Massimo's half-brother &amp; Laura's bodyguard) - The only character I somewhat liked. I honestly still don't get why he wasn't the main hero, he was so nice and caring toward Laura, truly the exact opposite of his brother. <br><br>Laura's mother - She was just like Olga, she would advice her something good only to discover her daughter's boyfriend is rich and tell her she did good.<br><br>Laura's exes (Martin &amp; Piotr) - Both bald headed, with tattoos, Laura definitely had a type before Massimo. Piotr was the ex that was an addict &amp; tried to drug Laura which resulted in Massimo killing him.<br><br>Laura and Massimo as a couple - Those two didn't really share any interests, they didn't talk a lot about anything aside from how perversed they are &amp; their sexual fantasies. Their whole relationship was build on violence, blackmail, anger and fighting. The amount of times Laura was terrified of Massimo and decided to just go along with whatever he was saying just so he doesn't get angry/violent is absolutely scary.<br>Based on everything that happened in this book I can absolutely say this: in no way does 365 dni show any kind of healty, consensual relationship. <br>The book crossed so many lines even for dark romance. One moment you would have Laura talk about Massimo being nice &amp; gentle when in reality you'd starring at your reading device/paperback in bewilderment because nothing like that was actually happening.<br><br>The writing/story/world building:<br><br>Aside from being very, very problematic, what's worth noting is that for a mafia 'romance' 365 dni was quite boring, even the final chapter of the book didn't have that much action or an ending that would make you want to read the next book immediately.<br>I would find myself reading 3 chapters in a row (I'm usually a very fast reader, but this book took me days to finish) &amp; then I would be feeling absolutely down from how repetitive the chapters were and all the stupid decisions the characters would make.<br>Blanka Lipi\u0144ska overuses a very cliched &amp; boring method for starting and ending the chapters - Opening her chapters with Laura waking up &amp; finishing them with her fainting or falling asleep (<i> A little statistic: Laura wakes up as beginning of chapter - Chapters: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 20 (insinuated), 21; Falls asleep as an end of a chapter - 2, 4, 8 &amp; 15 (insinuated), 19; Faints - Chapters: 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 (as end of a chapter too), 11, 15, 16, 18 (almost)</i>).<br>365 dni is combination of Laura waking up, sleeping, showering, giving Massimo blow jobs, faiting, throwing up &amp; long and detailed to a point of boredom (and for reaching a wordcount) descriptions of places, people and locations. Laura would literally describe Massimo in great detail almost every chapter and then add that this is how he usually looks (if that's how he look all the time why go out of your way to point it out every time?!)<br><br>When it comes to the story elements 365 dni follows E.L. James' Fifty Shades to a T: (I'm almost definitely forgetting a bunch of things that are 100% FS inspired, but these ones stood out to me when I was reading the book)<br><br>- Laura's nickname for Massimo is a color, Black <br>- Stalking the heroine (showing up at places where she would be)<br>- Watching the heroine sleep<br>- Having someone change her clothes (Grey undress Anastasia himself, Massimo has someone do that for him)<br>- Giving her a car (in this one it's actually multiple cars)<br>- Jealous of almost every straight male around her to a point of violence/outbursts (he's only fine with his half-brother being her bodyguard)<br>- An evil ex-lover (Massimo's) that set on ruining the new relationship<br>- Gushing over how good hero looks dressed all casually and being barefoot; how calm &amp; angelic he look while he sleeps<br>- Hero going to a store for the first time (having to buy something on his own, instead of sending people to do it)<br>- Heroine cooking breakfast for the hero<br>- Unexpected pregnancy<br>- Relationship is based on conditions (FS - Ana has to sign a contract/do what Grey likes; 365 dni - No running away or her parents die)<br>- Hero says he's not gonna touch the heroine until he has her consent (FS - consent has to be written; 365 dni - hero says the word consent and promises he won't do anything to heroine without it but doesn't keep said promise despite her saying words like \"no\" and \"stop\".)<br>- Calls the heroine \"baby\"<br>- Yacht scene<br>- Heroine accepts the fact she has to endure something she doesn't want to in order to stay with the hero/so he doesn't leave her<br>- Bath scene where the hero washes the heroine<br>- Hero is mad at heroine for doing something simple (FS- eye rolling; 365 dni- stretching when she wakes up)<br>- Heroine has a long line of men showing interest in her<br>- Hero/Heroine doesn't know how to make love<br>- Trying to fool the reader &amp; the heroine the hero has died/was killed somehow<br>- Heroine escapes to a parent's house<br>- Hero throws heroine over his shoulder<br>- A rival that wants to take advantage of the intoxicated heroine<br>- Hero tracks heroine down using a tracking device, app, etc.<br>- Car chase scene<br>- Heroine's best friend is interested in the Hero's brother<br>- Heroine has her own room in Hero's house, later moves into his once they're in 'love'<br>- Heroine has a bodyguard she's close with<br>- Hero wants Heroine's full submission and hates disobedience<br>- Hero drives a car like a GOD<br>- Hero has wounds on his chest<br>- Heroine goes without any underwear to a public event<br>- Hero &amp; Heroine have sex in a car<br>- Hero/Heroine sees the other's childhood room<br>- Hero is very set on making the heroine say YES to marrying him<br><br>Things that bothered me:<br><br>- How the author would unnecesary switch locations to a point it gives you a whiplash, sometimes it would be so confusing where the action is taking place.<br>- How Laura would say all these nice things about Massimo, about him being gentle, caring &amp; loving when he was all but that to her.<br>- How the book title leads you to believe the book would cover a whole year, but in reality it's just 3-4 months.<br>- The fact that the relationship was anything but consensual and healthy.<br>- The fact that Laura spend months with Massimo, she even said she loves him before she ever knew his last name!<br>- How the whole relatioship was only sex oriented instead of them forming some type of a bond too.<br>- The sex scenes were basically one and the same<br>- Laura somehow knowing things about Massimo's parents (and how Massimo's eyes would go all soft when he speaks about his dead mother) when we don't actually see them ever talking about anything personal like that<br>- How Blanka would introduce characters out of the blue with them not existing before the certain scene (Laura's bestfriend - she literally never mentions Olga before she needs someone to talk to in the middle of the book; Laura's brother/Laura's cousin's wedding - All mentioned once Blanka needs them for the plot, no prior mention before that).<br>- How Laura would talk about a character with: 'the young italian', etc. without mentioning the name of the character, so you basically have to guess who she's talking about.<br>- How Laura would go back and forth between thinking clearly and acting like she was brainwashed by Massimo's dick.<br>- The fact this is yet another book that romanticizes and tries to normalize abuse<br>I'm sure there are more things I'm forgetting that were problematic and made me angry.<br><br><br>To summarize, 365 dni is a very badly written book that copies Fifty shades to a T &amp; supports a toxic, abusive relationship. <br>It's a book that has scenes that cross the line into rape and try to pass them as romantic.<br>The story flows slow, doesn't have that much action to keep you invested, often bores you to death &amp; lacks characters that you can truly root for.<br>The chapters are poorly written, very repetitive and predictable and sometimes end like the author forgot to finish them, the twists aren't at all surprising or exciting. The scenes are at times too detailed to a point it feels like it's all for the word count.<br><br><b>If you're wondering if you should read this after seeing the 'STEAMY' trailer: Don't. This book is not worth your time. What you see in the trailer isn't what you get in the book.</b>",

    "text": "I would have never read this trash if a movie had not been made on it.<br /><br />A woman is kidnapped by an Italian don because apparently he had seen her before in his dreams and had sociopathically hung her exact portraits all around the house. This woman is the most unrealistic of the characters. She treats her kidnap as a vacation and her kidnapper as a lover. This can not even be classified as a case of Stockholm Syndrome because this behavior is displayed on just the next day of kidnapping. It is definitely not a survival behavior because she doesn't even go through the basic emotions and experiences a person kidnapped undergoes. <br /><br />Kidnapping and imprisonment is just a way for author to keep the the female protagonist confined to have her at complete mercy of her kidnapper so that he can use her as a sex slave. But the author can not put the truth simply as that so she cloaks it under the impression of different kind of romance and love. <br /><br />This is where the author and stupid lovers of this book are completely wrong. Abuse is not romance. Coercion is not romance. Violence is not romance. Crime is not romance. Mafia is not romance.<br /><br />Italian mafia is highly romanticised because of the apparently exotic looks of Italian males which brings readers under the false predisposition that bosses in mafia are all Italian and all gorgeous when in reality, mafia leaders are usually old middle-aged creepy pedophiles with the most misogynistic of attitudes. Criminals treat people worst and that includes women. There is nothing slightly romantic about being a sex toy of a criminal. The money and luxury that comes with it is never hers but just a payment in exchange of her sexual services which will stop when the men get bored and they will get bored because the women is just a body to them.<br /><br />Lust and physical attraction is not love. Just because someone wants to have sex with you doesn't mean that they care and like you. They can use and trash you without a blink of an eye.<br /><br />These kinds of books are so harmful to condition of women in society especially when movies are made of them. Fifty Shades Of Grey romanticised violence against women during sex and 365 days is going to romanticise forceful captivation of women because obviously if the man loves her, then the woman is definitely going to fall head over heels in love with her kidnapper and they would live happily ever after. <br /><br />This may sound judgemental but it is true that the women who write and adore such books are classic cases of internally misogynistic women. <br /><br />The female protagonist slutshames the escort women forgetting that she gives the male protagonist sex and he gives her money which is the definition of being a whore and while she is relishing this lifestyle, there is a high chance that the women escort is there because of sex-trafficking and would give the world to leave this lifestyle . She bends over backwards to please men and has such negative attitude towards women. This is what internally misogynistic women are. They think that this is a world of men and women have to survive by competing over each other in pleasing men. These are the women who join <br />men in mocking feminists. <br /><br />No man ever writes about his kind in such a degrading way but we have hordes of women writing about women in a worse manner than even some misogynistic men. It is so sad that feminists fight so much for equal rights for women and then there are some women who fantasise about getting treated like pathetic sexual objects if they are being pampered with luxury and free superficial materials. Pedophiles and domestic abusers exist to portray how manipulative and abusive sexual relationships can be. <br /><br />The wrong ideas given to both men and women are so detrimental to the society. Women are suggested that they like to be treated degradingly and men are suggested that women like to be treated degradingly making women the victim again in the end and making their lives even worse in this patriarchal world. <br /><br />Books influence society and movies even more so I'm really concerned how more and more degrading female protagonists are becoming in these \"romantic\" books and movies. We had Anna and now we have Laura. I fear that the next one will be openly a sex slave and still some women will be swooning over it.",

I read this because I had heard so many people buzzing about the movie based on it last summer (which I have not seen and now definitely won't), and wow do I regret it. Not only does this glamorize an extremely abusive relationship, but it does so while also being extremely misogynistic and fatphobic. And on top of my issues with the content, the book itself had horrible pacing and the plot made absolutely no sense. This book was just all around a HARD miss for me, and if you somehow still have any intention to read it, please take care of yourself and be mindful of any trigger warnings.<br /><br />TW: sexual assault, coercion, kidnapping, emotional manipulation, murder, violence, slut shaming, food shaming, drug/alcohol use",

Massimo had a dream after being shot, or possibly a near death experience in which he saw the face of a woman and ever since he has been searching for this woman. <br><br><b>The heroine:</b> <u>Laura Biel</u> - After achieving her dream job, she realizes she is bored and quits work for a while. She is on vacation in Italy with her boyfriend and some friends. While in Italy, she meets Massimo at a few different places and is both intrigued by him and scared of him. <br><br><b>The Love Story:</b>Massimo kidnaps Laura and threatens her loved ones if she tries to escape. He proposes that she stay with him for 365 days in which he will try to get her to fall in love with him. He says he won\u2019t force her to do anything she doesn\u2019t want to do. Though in making her stay and threatening her family, isn\u2019t he doing just that??? <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1609138521i/30597815._SY540_.png\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Someone told me the Netflix movie is basically porn. I am not really a watcher of porn, but I am now wanting to see the movie after picturing Massimo doing all the things he has done in this book. The book is somewhat porn, but not strictly smutty porn. There is definitely a story and I enjoyed it. Though I must say since many people hate captive romance books due to the whole force and/or Stockholm syndrome aspects, I am not bothered by them. <br><br>I like dark and twisty books and characters. Though Massimo wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as many of the anti-hero\u2019s of captive romance that I have read. Also unlike many people, I don\u2019t think romance novels need to be seen as a purveyor of what the world should be like and I don\u2019t think romance authors should only write characters that are good to make some sort of statement about what is right and what is wrong. I think they can be just plain entertainment and I like dark sexy men in my books even when they do wrong.<br><br>Massimo grew up in a violent world, he is used to being violent in many ways, especially in bed. But he has real feelings for Laura and he wants her to fall in love with him. So he is trying to be gentle with her. However, Laura is being held hostage, so she fights Massimo at every turn. He sees her fight (including being insolent and slapping him) as her disrespecting him. As a Don, he is not used to being shown disrespect so he often reacts violently. <br><br>Though not as violently as I expected. Massimo\u2019s mood often turns on a dime and he will go from walking or sitting peacefully to jumping on her and speaking or doing something harshly. However, he notices when she shows fear and tends to back off. It gets to the point where Massimo backing off isn\u2019t always what Laura really wants. <br><br>Like I said, and like many books with BDSM elements, there are a ton of steamy situations and sizzling content in this book. I was surprised that with 476 ratings on GR, the overall rating is less than 4 stars. Though since I am reading an ARC from Netgalley, I assume that many of those are reviews polish version. Possibly it was improved for the English version or maybe I just liked it better than most. Either way, I did think the story was terrific. My overall rating is 4.6, rounded up to 5 stars. It is sexy, romantic and I do plan to continue reading the series, so there you have it!<br><br>Lastly for those that compared this book to Fifty Shades, there are some BDSM elements so if that is enough to compare one book to another then they are alike in that only. Massimo is much more alpha male (in my opinion) than Christian Grey and he isn\u2019t damaged like Christian is damaged by his early abuse and his mother\u2019s friend. Massimo is a Mafia Kingpin and is used to having his way and he doesn\u2019t have a red room. So other than some kinky sexual proclivities, I didn\u2019t really see any comparison. <br><br>I voluntarily read &amp; reviewed an advanced copy of this book.

Our tastes our different. And I won't judge you, but I will be judging these characters since I took so much trouble and time to read this story (yeah I actually went to Google, searched for the english version and downloaded a PDF and read this thing).<br><br>To the ones who fell for this one and is excited in reading this.........<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1630002710ra/31836550.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>You are not alone in that. But like I said appearances can be deceiving. <br> <br>So here is my honest review on this book (NOT THE MOVIE).....<br>My reasons for rating this a one star:-<br><br><b>\n  <u>No 1 : The Beginning</u>\n</b><br><br>The story starts with Massimo, our H forcing a flight attendant to give him a blowjob(how romantic! *shudders*). <br><br>Ok this WAS NOT how I was expecting the beginning! <br><br>Blood spilling/Murder/Kidnapping : No problem!<br>Robbed the China Construction Bank: Cool!<br>Stole the moon: Awesome!<br><s>Got on an airplane and got a blowjob</s>: Not cool man. Not cool!<br><br>Most mafia romances, I read started with some kind of violence, flashback, signing a contract or something similar. I'm not saying I was expecting those same beginnings but I was hoping it would be something thrilling. NOT a fucking blowjob. The beginning of a story is important. Especially the first 5 pages. Because it's the beginning that makes a reader choose between carrying on reading further or just stopping it right there. <br><br>In my opinion the beginning was disgusting and disappointing! I mean, who want to read about some blowjob the second you turn the open the first page. Not me!<br>If it was him fucking someone it would have been ok. But force and blowjob..........those two words did NOT work for me at all!<br><br><b>\n  <u>No 2 :The Title and The Blurb</u>\n</b><br><br>This title and blurb is a total lie. The title says <u>365 dni(days)</u> as in a mobster kidnaps the girl in his dreams and gives her 365 days to <u>fall in love with him</u>.<br><br>In reality the h <i>fell in love</i> with H in a less than fucking 5 months. As in falling in love.....poof. There was NO love between them. I will be explaining about it afterwards.<br><br><b>\n  <u>No 3 : The Plot</u>\n</b><br><br>I think 3/4 of this book's chapters' ended with the h falling asleep or fainting and began with her waking up. Either the this author didn't know how to end this or this girl got a serious heart problem or amenia or something similar. I mean fainting is ok but when the h faints like once in 10 pages, the story is gets boring.<br><br>This story is supposed to be a <i>Mafia</i> romance. And <i>Mafia</i> means there's gotta be some actions and blood spilling. Call me bloodthirsty, but I like my romances with a few murders and fights. But unfortunately for poor me, this book did not have those. I don't think any of those fights went far more than a page or two and they were all poorly written. It was like there were no fight at all. And yup all of them ended with the h fainting or the h and H arguing.<br><br>This story does NOT have a plot at all. The author kept changing places out of the blue and many characters (all of them were nut cases) were introduced for no reason. There were not much dialogues exchanged between the h and H. Most of the time it was just long descriptions about places, how Massimo looked and their wild fucking.And the sex was the same thing *copy pasted* over again and again. Plot twists weren't thrilling. The title says 365 days but it took like 4 weeks for this whore to fall to this abuser. Bleh!<br><br><b>\n  <u>No 4 : Massimo &amp; Laura : Their Chemistry</u>\n</b><br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1630000302ra/31836407.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br><br>I hated Laura. She was neither an innocent sweet girl or a badass sassy bitch She was just some gold digging, horny whore. She would do anything if you just hand her some money or jewelry. She can goes hours about shoes and can do pole dance like a stripper. Anyone who have read Bound By Honor, remember Luca's crazy ex Grace? Laura is just like her. She is one of the most weakest and shallowest heroine I ever seen. When she gets kidnapped, she doesn't even cry or get terrified or scream like normal people will, which makes me think if she's a human being at all. She fights like 3 times and just give in. She doesn't care much about the H expect his good looking body and his money. She also is mood changer. One moment she's fighting with Massimo and the next she's begging him to fuck her. She does things without reason(colors her hair).She was disgusting. <br><br>And as for Massimo. Ugh I hated him too. He uses sex as a weapon and he is one of those guys who can't keep their dicks in their pants for like 5 mins. He loves forcing and fearing his partners in unhealthy ways. You can't even call it sex. Most of the time I would say it was rape. Sex with no emotions and all I can do but rape I hate it. The most disgusting thing was when he had a blowjob in front of Laura, the woman he claimed he's in love with and his forever. I mean what kind of a man will do that! He doesn't even care about Laura. He loves forcing her to do things she doesn't like, doesn't care when she faints or get sick (best example: laura gets scared of flying on his jet but Massimo instead of calming her down, tie her up and force her to sit and then finger fucks her *GAGS*.) Just because he is a mobster doesn't mean he's got a right to rape someone and violate innocent people's lives (yeah he goes far as to trying to kill Laura's ex lovers). Massimo is an extreme psychopath. I mean this man have serious mental issues. <br><br>The most surprising thing here was how in the world did he remember Laura's face so clearly? In the story it claims he only caught a glimpse and had a vision about Laura and then he ordered a pianist to paint pictures of her all over the villa. There was no picture or sketch of Laura for the pianist to draw her and the guy hasn't even seen her. So HOW IN THE WORLD COULD HE PAINT A FUCKIN PICTURE OF LAURA WITHOUT ANY MISTAKES? Plain weird!!<br><br>There were no chemistry or love between them. And yet the h claims she's in love with the H in a less than 5 months held in his captive. And there's even no connection between them. They don't even talk, they just fuck like bunnies. I'm surprised Laura even knows his name because when she professed her love she didn't even know his last name.<br>Violence and rape is not love. You can't even call this Stockholm Syndrome. This is plain crazy weird. This book felt more like porn than an actual book because the author didn't seem to care about the plot holes,except only the sexual fantasies which made me sick. And as for BDSM and kink *snorts* Massimo is not a Dom at all. Being a Dom means taking care of your partners and their needs while satisfying your own. That is the number one rule when being a Dominant. And Massimo was a selfish manwhore who cared only about himself. He doesn't stop even when his partner says\"No\".<br><br>Love.....does this author know at least what that word means? Love means cherishing, caring learning about your partner and this..........there was no love between them. Not even lust because Massimo seems to get a hard on everytime he sees a beautiful woman . This is more like porn than a love story. Because this love story only contains fainting, forcing, blackmail, rape, shopping, assault, mental abuse and blowjobs with different women. Yuck!!<br> <br><br><b>\n  <u>No 5 : Similarities to Fifty Shades of Grey</u>\n</b><br><br>I'm no fan of FSOG but this book was just a bad version of it written in Polish. I mean, this author literally copied most things from FSOG. I don't mind if she was inspired by E.L James and wrote a book but literally coping off everything E.L James wrote was disgusting.

    "text": "I kinda lost it when his dick was compared to a candle attached to a birthday cake.<br /><br />Massimo Toricelli is the leader of the Sicilian mafia. Years ago he was shot several times and when he was almost dead he dreamed of a stunning unknown woman. After so long searching, he finally found her. Her name is Laura Biel, a polish woman spending her twenty-ninth birthday in Sicily. Massimo kidnaps her and keeps her captive. His game is: having her under his control for 365 days, while she must fall in love with him.<br /><br />This is ridiculously bad. I couldn't even get mad, because it's just pathetic.<br /><br />First of all: the book doesn't deliver what it promises. What we can expect from the synopsis is that Massimo will keep Laura captive for one year and at the end of the book we'll see if she's in love with him or not (the answer being very predictable). See, the one year thing is very important, because it's literally the title of the book. What we get.... three months. Yeah, three months.<br /><br />It may sound stupid, but I need to say the obvious: the relationship here is abusive. Massimo is totally controlling and possessive, and holds all the power.<br /><br />Since the very start, Grey states... oops! Did I say Grey? I meant Black! Yes, Laura's nickname for Massimo is Black. (We can even see the originality running in the background. I'm touched).<br /><br />What was I saying? So, let's talk about consent. Since the very start, Massimo states that he has no intention to rape Laura. Yeah. He says it several times. You could ask me why he needs to keep reassuring that, but I think you can deduce the answer... Because there are a lot of almost-rapes. See, Massimo can't help himself! He says explicitly that <b> he can't control </b> his body. In case you don't know, this is a very, very popular excuse used by real abusers to justify their harassment and rape. There's a particulary disturbing moment when after a rape attempt he says that <b>since he's so used to violence it's really, really hard for him to not use violence when someone denies pleasure to him. And Laura feels PITY for him. Poor rapist, he's having his pleasure denied!</b> This is not how things work. Healthy men are totally and completely responsible for their actions, not mattering how much \"temptation\" they face. Now that we have this cleared, another <i>fact</i> for you: bodies can't consent. <b>Physical reactions DON'T consent.</b> It's still rape and abuse if the victim's body reacts to the aggressor's touch. The victim's pleasure is another excuse used by real rapists to stand for their actions. This book is extremely disrespectful toward abuse survivors.<br /><br />Still about Massimo: he isn't a person, or even a character. Where his personality and characterisation should be, there's a huge blank space. In case you haven't guessed, Laura does fall in love with him, but I still don't get exactly what she falls for. He is totally EMPTY!!!!!! \"Abusive\" ISN'T A FREAKING PERSONALITY. Laura says he is gentle and caring, but that doesn't make much sense, since they spend all their time together having sex (with consent? Who knows. At certain point the sex scenes were so UNCOUNTABLE that I coundn't pay attention anymore).<br /><br />Ha! The love interest isn't the only man in Laura's life. She has some abusive ex's, so Massimo can protect her properly, of course (and also from another random guy who tries to rape her). For some reason, he seems to not figure out that if he plans to harm or kill every single man who hurts Laura, the first target would be himself.<br /><br />Sometimes I actually want authors to forget LGBT people. This is one of those times. No, Laura, gays don't exist to serve you. What the hell. We have the usual: misogynist and ableist language, but next to the end we have also a racist description. *Sigh*<br /><br />Now, something good: our heroine isn't a innocent virgin! She has a lot of sexual experience, masturbates, etc. About her...<br /><br />Laura is...well, would you forgive so freaking fast a rapist stalker who threatened to harm your family if he had a fine dick? I'm asking because, at least for me, his dick seemed very ugly.",

If you don't like it, don't buy it, don't read it and don't watch it.

Nothing to compare to the poor quality of fifty shades which is very cutesy.<br /><br />I understand the references with the bal, the one sex scene that looks like bondage but is not. No BDSM whatsoever. None. <br /><br />I agree that the author was probably inspired by 50shades as few scenes were similar but better. I don\u2019t mind better. I welcome better. <br /><br />Some mentioned Stockholm syndrome. I disagree. Yes she was kidnapped but never ever abused. In fact pretty spoiled. And she decided when. She also accepted a 365 days deal. <br /><br />And for the naysayers, I wonder if you ever read romances before. What do you say about the cavemen heroes that shout cunt in the middle of a sex scene... or a 25 years old virgin who is deflowered and penetrated multiple times anal included with hardly some foreplay with generally anacondas dicks. Because it is books it is \u201cokay\u201d?... hundred of romances on the market... yet I hardly see reviews calling bloody murder abuser about it... So we all have our own visions. For me, she accepted the deal when she called her mother with nobody behind her twisting her hand to say it.<br /><br />Some mentioned rape? No rape whatsoever. SHE initiated the sex. She fell madly in love with a dangerous man.<br /><br />I mean I started to read a review and it was pure hate. OMG \ud83d\ude33 <br /><br />I loved the movie. I loved the actors. I loved the plot. I think it was romancing the thugs but it is just that... a romance. So I didn\u2019t expect everything perfect.

The chemistry just exploded. It was violent and raw. And a passionate love story.<br /><br />Yes the ending is not a happy ending but it is a trilogy.... movie 2 is on its way 2021... and movie 3 after.<br /><br />Because I love spoilers I already know to expect 2 major twists...<br /><br />Since I believe books are always better than movies, I cannot wait for the English translation not yet done June 2020.",

It's intriguing to me and I felt there was potential for a great story here. Sadly, I have heard some spoilers that I'm not liking and that made me hesitate. But I decided I would lower my expectations and give it a go. <br /><br />So, here are my thoughts on this much anticipated and hyped up book. As much as I would like to give the book credit, it's my opinion that it's the actor Michele Morrone is the reason for the hype. He's a sexy guy and there are some intense sexual scenes in the movie based off this book. Even though I'm giving the actor the credit for the hype, the book was actually pretty good, but with a few issues.<br /><br />I was conflicted over rating this. I decided on 4 because overall, the storyline proved to be just as intriguing as I had hoped. I also really liked the chemistry between the main characters. That chemistry you saw in the movie is what you get in this book. My issue was there were times I felt the writing was a bit off. It felt like a story that was professional cleaned up but missed a few spots. Maybe some things were just lost in the translation to English. Either way, it was enough to notice but not enough to ruin the book for me. <br /><br />As for the main characters, Massimo Torricelli was an intense anti-hero. His obsession with the heroine is one of the draws for me with this book. He's very dominant and not a nice guy but he tried very hard to be better for Laura. He is mafia and the author kept him real to that role. I'm just really glad she didn't have him abuse Laura, because that is one thing I don't like for a hero to do to his heroine. He was firm and a bit rough at times with her but also very protective. She was his dream for so long, he just desperately didn't want her to disappear.<br /><br />Laura was a harder character for me to like. Her reactions are very unrealistic. It's a book so I really shouldn't hold that against it, but I can't help but think this could have been better with a more proper reaction to certain scenes. She also came off a bit bratty at times and I'm not a fan of that. She's not the worst I've read and for me, it's all about the hero anyway.<br /><br />One of the spoilers I learned did happen in this book. It was also in the movie. Did I like it? No. Did it ruin the book for me? Also no. Now, the other spoilers I heard that must happen in later books could be a deal breaker for me if they are true. That's something I am going to have to think on before I continue with the series. To be continued...or not.",

    "text": "My thanks to the author, publisher and NetGalley for a free ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I was appalled at how badly written this book was - and yet it is a bestseller in Europe. I dislike stories where caricatures, as opposed to characters, are presented to the reader, and the author pieces together hackneyed scenes that she pulled from this or that miniseries. Trite is another word that came to mind. Deluded was another - that would be Laura, the female who is the object of Massimo's obsession and desire.<br /><br /> Massimo is a brutish mobster who decides to kidnap the woman whose face came to him during a comatose vision. He is going to force her to love him and stay with him, even though she is engaged to another man.<br /><br />Why do women think we can \"save\" someone like Massimo - or anyone else, for that matter. I have seen so many relationships where one partner took on the burdens of his or her spouse in an effort to \"save\" or help them. These unequal relationships seldom end happily. I was fed up by the end of this story. Materialism: that is what Laura loves. She gushes about the beautiful dress she will wear, etc. I wanted to toss my ereader out the window at one point: all of these characters were just a mash up of brutal or foolish cartoon characters. I believe this is a series? Well, I don't think I'll be holding my breath until the next thrilling installment comes along. And no, I won't be watching the movie based on this novel. I don't even want to give this one star. <br /><br />Barbara Cartland could do better from the grave - and she dictated all of her romances while in a trance - or so the story goes. I never read any of Barbara Cartland's novels either. The same trashy lust for power and money. I was told once when I was very young that women admired rich and powerful men because they could not hope to be rich and powerful in their own right, by their own endeavours. Well, this author just rehashed that ridiculous premise and is now raking in the big bucks. This novel makes 50 Shades of Grey sound like literary fiction in comparison. At least L. James could write a decent sentence and more believable, rounded characters.<br /><br />I refuse to glamorize mafia/biker/drug lord heroes - these are bad men who profit off of human misery. They enslave women and children and do not deserve my time or notice. Like war, I do not give them the time of day. I wish I had read the blurb on this one more closely and avoided having to read this at all.",

I remember that I started to watch the movie back when it came out ... but then I stopped. Mainly because I found out that it was a series and I hate cliffhangers. But also because I don't like Mafia and kidnapping stories. But the movie wasn't bad - at least the first bit that I watched. Beautiful scenery and music. Pretty people. Weird English accents, but that was ok - the actors and characters were Italian and Polish. But as I said, I stopped watching because ... cliffy.<br>Same with the book. I didn't want to read it, because of the Mafia and kidnapping and cliffy thing, but then I thought ...pfff... why not!?<br>So, here I am. Having read it.<br>And it wasn't bad. At all. I was afraid I would have to DNF after a few percent. Especially because I saw so many bad reviews and lots of people saying how the translation was so horrible. But since I can't speak Polish, I didn't really notice what was wrong with it. But yes, the language was a bit weird. It was translated by a Polish guy, so that's the first thing the publisher did wrong. You need to let a lady translate a book written by a lady. The whole 'voice' of the heroine gets lost this way. And I think they should've used a team of translators - both native and non-native Polish speakers. I highlighted so many mistakes and wrongly used expressions and weird lines - which I hope will be corrected before the book is released! <br>But it wasn't too horrible.<br>The book is written in Laura's POV - which is a bit sad. I really loved the first chapter - in Massimo's POV. But that was the only time we got to hear his thoughts.<br>The book starts as a cute holiday thingy. And yes, we know that Massimo wants to kidnap Laura, but still - the first part was cute and harmless. And then we kind of have to overlook the ridiculousness of the whole <i>You-appeared-in-my-mind-when-I-almost-died-and-now-that-I-know-you're-real-I-have-to-own-you</i> thing. Because if we do overlook that, and if we also overlook how fast Laura accepts her new life, and the sometimes very weird sexy moments, then it's a really great love story. It's sexy, but not too disgustingly weird and bdsm-ish - like the movie and the trailers might've suggested. And it's also very sweet and <i>Pretty Woman/Cinderella</i>-ish with all the shopping and traveling and constant champagne-drinking rich-people stuff. And of course it's also exciting with the whole Mafia and killing and danger part. <br><br>What I found a tiny bit weird was how often she called him <i>The Man in Black</i>. That should've been the title of the book. But I guess it sounds or looks really weird as a title in Polish. <br><br>I have to admit that there was never a second where I thought - eww - I need to stop reading this sh*t right the eff now. Nope. I really enjoyed it. And I was excited to see how it would end. If there would be a huge cliffy or if somebody would die or be kidnapped - for real. But it wasn't a bad cliffy. Wasn't really a cliffy at all. The story is just not finished yet. There's a lot more coming - and I'm really looking forward to reading book #2.<br><br>So, to summarize my review - Laura/Blanka says it best herself at around the 70% mark: ... <i>this wouldn't be an ordinary, boring life - more like a gangster movie sprinkled with some porn.</i><br>LOL! \ud83d\ude02<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573549060i/28438349.jpg\" width=\"258\" height=\"45\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WeFb7o\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573548581i/28438331.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\ud83d\udc9c<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3a0wTIK\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573548581i/28438332.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\ud83d\udc9c<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oTNl1m\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573548581i/28438333.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a><br><a href=\"https://getbook.at/365Days1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573548581i/28438334.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a><br><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/BJsBookBlog\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573565061i/28439634.png\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a><br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BJsBookBlog\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img alt=\"Smokin Hot Book Blog\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573565061i/28439630.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/BJsBookBlog/posts/?ref=page_internal\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img alt=\"Smokin Hot Book Blog\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573565061i/28439632.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a> <a href=\"https://instagram.com/BJsBookBlog\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img alt=\"Smokin Hot Book Blog\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573565061i/28439629.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a> <a href=\"mailto:bjbookblog@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img alt=\"Smokin Hot Book Blog\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573565061i/28439633.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a> <a href=\"https://www.BJsBookBlog.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img alt=\"Smokin Hot Book Blog\" src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1573565061i/28439631.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a> ",

It hops around and attention must be paid or you will find yourself flipping back a few pages to reestablish the thread of the story. I took this on a plane flight, crazy right? Not exactly the normal \"light\" reading I take on flights. It was a stroke of genius. I absolutely fell under the thrall of Dostoyevky's prose. (Thank you to my fellow travelers who didn't feel the need to chat with the guy who obviously is so frilling bored he has resorted to reading a Russian novel.) I zipped through three hundred pages like it was butter and found myself absolutely captivated by the evolving drama of the Brothers Karamazov, the women that drive them crazy, and the father that brings to mind the words justifiable homicide.<br><br>I have to give a plug to these Everyman's Library editions. A 776 page novel that feels like a 300 page novel. Despite the smaller size, the print size is still easily readable. I will certainly be picking up more of these editions especially the Russian novels that are translated by the magical duo of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. <br><br><a href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/albums/x462/jkeeten/?action=view&amp;current=translators-pevear-volokhonsky.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1532032120i/25998864.jpg\" alt=\"Photobucket\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a><br><b>Translators Volokhonsky and Pevear</b><br><br>One of my complaints, when I was in college, and liked to torture myself with the largest most incomprehensible Russian books I could find, was that the nicknames and diminutives of various Russian names increased my frustration level and decreased my ability to comprehend the plots. I certainly spent too much time scratching my head and reading feverishly to see if I could figure out from the interactions of the characters if Vanky was actually Ivan or Boris or Uncle Vashy. I did not have that issue with this book. Despite a plot that skipped around I did not experience the confusion that has marred my memories of other Russian novels. <br><br>This is the story of the Karamazov family. The father Fyodor and his four sons. There are three legitimate sons Dmitri, Ivan and Alyosha, but I believe that Smerdyakov is also an illegitimate son, though not confirmed by the author given the tendencies of Fyodor to hop on anything in a skirt I would say chances are pretty good that the boy is a Karamazov. <br><br>The recklessness at which Fyodor lived his life is really the basis of the plot. The motivations of the other characters all revolve around reactions to the careless and insensitive behavior of the father. Dostoyevsky wrote a description of Fyodor that still gives me a shiver every time I read it. <br><br>\"Fyodor's physiognomy by that time presented something that testified acutely to the characteristics and essence of his whole life. Besides the long, fleshy bags under his eternally insolent, suspicious, and leering little eyes, besides the multitude of deep wrinkles on his fat little face, a big Adam's apple, fleshy and oblong like a purse, hung below his sharp chin, giving him a sort of repulsively sensual appearance. Add to that a long, carnivorous mouth with plump lips, behind which could be seen the little stumps of black, almost decayed teeth. He sprayed saliva whenever he spoke.\"<br><br><blockquote>\n  <a href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/albums/x462/jkeeten/?action=view&amp;current=Fyodor.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n    <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1532032120i/25998865.jpg\" alt=\"Fyodor\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n</blockquote><br><br>Fyodor is a skirt chaser and since he is rich he can afford to throw these opulent parties that evolve/devolve into orgies with the local women. Given the description above I can only speculate that gallons and gallons of good vodka must be in play to achieve this end. Problems mount as he falls in love/lust with a young beauty of dubious morals named Grushenka. <br><br><a href=\"https://s1183.photobucket.com/albums/x462/jkeeten/?action=view&amp;current=r-crumb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1532032120i/25998866.jpg\" alt=\"Photobucket\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a><br><br>His oldest son Dmitri is also in love with this young woman and as they both vie for her hand the tension between the Karamazov's ratchets up to dangerous levels. Dmitri while pursuing this dangerous siren throws over Katerina, a girl that he owes 3,000 rubles. After Fyodor is murdered (It was similar to waiting around for someone to kill J.R.)those same rubles become central to the subsequent trial to convict Dmitri of the murder. The murderer is revealed to the reader and as the trial advances the tension increases as we begin to wonder just how the truth will be revealed. <br><br>There are subplots with Father Zosima and his life before becoming a monk. Alyosha, the youngest son, was studying to be a monk under Zosima's tutelage, but becomes embroiled in the power struggles of the family and leaves the monastery to seek a life in the real world. Alyosha also becomes involved with the care of a dying child named, Ilyusha who is in the book to illustrate the heavy burden that the seemingly inconsequential actions of people can leave on others. The book explores that theme extensively. <br><br>It was fascinating to watch the ripple effects of each character's actions as the chapters advance. Every time I picked this book up I had to read large chunks because it simply would not let me go. The reactions and high drama created by the smallest spark of contention in the characters kept the pages turning and as new information snapped into place I found my pulse quickening as my brain sprang ahead trying to guess where Dostoyevsky was taking me next. <br><br>I worked with a young woman years ago that said that I reminded her of one of the Karamazov brothers. Because of the diverse personalities of the brothers, and the fact that I can see a little of myself in each brother I'm still left with the grand mystery as to which brother she was referring too. It serves me right for waiting so long to read this beautiful book. <br><br>If you wish to see all my most recent book and movie reviews check out <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.jeffreykeeten.com\">http://www.jeffreykeeten.com</a>",

    "text": "If there was still any doubt, let me confirm that this actually is the greatest book ever written. But be warned that you need to set aside a solid month to get through it. And it's not light reading--this is a dense work of philosophy disguised as a simple murder mystery. But it's well worth the effort. It tackles the fundamental question of human existence--how best to live one's life--in a truly engaging way. Dostoevsky created 3 brothers (Ivan, Alexei, and Dmitri) with opposite answers to this fundamental question, and set them loose in the world to see what would happen. A testament to Dostoevsky's genius is he didn't know how the book would evolve when he started writing. As a consequence, the book really isn't about the plot at all, but about how these brothers evolve and deal with their struggles based on their differing world views.<br /><br />Dostoevsky articulates, better than anyone, how human beings really are what I would call \"walking contradictions\". Perhaps all of our struggles in life boil down to the reality that we desire contradictory things, simultaneously. If you like your novels with good character development, this is the masterwork. Dostoevsky's characters are more real, more human, than any other. At different points along the way, you will identify with them, sympathize with them, curse them, agonize over them, celebrate them. You will be moved.<br /><br />Reading this book was a deeply personal experience for me, because I saw myself in one of the characters, and I didn't like what I saw. My worldview, in fact my entire direction in life, shifted as a result of this experience. I can't guarantee the same results for you, but you owe it to yourself to set aside the time, someday, for the Brothers Karamazov.<br /><br />Be sure to read the Pevear Volokhonsky translation.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review as I read. Frankly, I'm astounded by how good this is and how compelling I'm finding it. Astounded? Why should that be? This is a classic, after all. True, but it breaks just about every \"rule\" of fiction. The plot so far is virtually nonexistent: three brothers get together with their wastrel father and all sorts of dysfunction, including an odd love triangle involving the father and the eldest son, are revealed. The brothers aren't particular close to each other, and really not much happens except that they meet at a monastery, where the youngest son lives, for an audience with a holy man who's dying, and then they go their separate ways, except that they have kind of random meetings with each other and with the woman involved in the love triangle, and there's a vague sense of foreboding that something will happen to the father. And the characters? Not really the kinds of characters we're used to in contemporary fiction. These are characters who struggle with all kinds of philosophical issues and enjoy nothing more than debating them at length with each other. Sounds boring? Well, it's not. Not at all. <br /><br />By the way, I'm reading the Ignet Avsey translation based on Kris's recommendation, and it's wonderful so far!<br /><br />***<br /><br />One of the things I find so fascinating about this book is how it can be both one of the most dark and cynical works I've read, and one of the most overtly spiritual and soulful. This is a true testament to Dostoyevsky's range, to how effortlessly he \"contains multitudes\" in this masterful work.<br /><br />***<br /><br />[Alert: Some Spoilers to Follow]<br /><br />One of the most cynical passages I've read so far is about how, following the holy man's death, his fellow monks are all shocked when his corpse begins to smell. Because of course if he'd been a true holy man, they figured, his corpse wouldn't have smelled at all, so the fact that it started smelling makes them all begin to question whether he'd really been what they'd imagined. Soon several of them begin to remember times when he'd been shockingly and suspiciously less-than-holy, and then the pile-on really begins, as the monks begin competing to disavow him the most, with only a couple of his friends holding onto his good memory, but even they are cowed into silence by the general gleeful animosity. Oh, this Dostoyevsky really knows how to plumb all that's dark and pathetic about human nature.<br /><br />***<br /><br />After about page 500, the plot really picks up. We have murder, a mad dash to a woman, heavy drinking, protestations of love, and the police moving in. After the languid plotting of the opening sections, I'm almost breathless!<br /><br />***<br /><br />The use of the narrator here is so interesting. We have a nameless figure who lives in the place where the events take place recounting the story almost as if recounting a legend. At the same time, we get the characters' most intimate thoughts and long speeches that the narrator could not possibly have known first-hand. It all adds to the notion that this may be more the narrator's own tall tale than any faithful recitation of history--which of course is true, because it's a novel, but the way the artificial nature of the story gets highlighted makes me think it's another example of Dostroyevsky's cynicism at work.<br /><br />***<br /><br />All signs point to Dmitry as the perpetrator, but the way he protests his innocence just makes you want to believe him! He's having a hard time of it, though. The prosecutor and magistrate conduct a long interview of him, and the evidence is damning.<br /><br />Interestingly, after Dmitry is taken away, the scene shifts radically, revisiting the young boys we'd briefly met earlier. What is Dostroyevsky doing here? In the figure of Kolya, a 13 year-old prankster wunderkind, he seems to be pointing out the limits of rationalism, the way it can be abused to wow those with slightly less knowledge and how it can ultimately come off as a big joke.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Now things have become complicated. Who's really guilty of this crime? We know who \"did it\" because he tells Ivan, but then he blames Ivan himself for his athiesm--for influencing him by the notion that nothing we do matters anyway.<br /><br />***<br /><br />At the beginning of the trial, we see Dostoyevsky's biting and cynical nature reassert itself, as he describes the spectacle that the event has become--the people who've traveled from far away to witness it, drawn by their desire to see the two female rivals for Dmitry and Dmitry himself, who's especially attractive to the ladies because of his reputation as a \"ladies' man.\" The proceedings themselves seem secondary to the spectacle and the sport.<br /><br />***<br /><br />The trial itself is a fascinating deconstruction of Dmitry's character--how that character can be everything the prosecutor says, and yet at the same time, it's everything his defense counsel says too. We're given to long speeches about the character that are fascinating psychological studies (the lawyers themselves debate about this newfangled science of psychology--how plastic it is, how it can be used to justify and explain anything). You can see Dostoyevsky working on multiple levels here, showing multiple sides of his character that don't quite cohere, and that's exactly the point, that people are complex and inconsistent and constantly at war with themselves, so what does \"character\" mean? What does \"a\" character mean in a novel? <br /><br />And just when it looks like the defense will carry the day....<br /><br />***<br /><br />The coda is a plan for escape and the funeral of a young boy, and yet it end on a curiously uplifting note, a statement of faith and everlasting remembrance--and a change, for the better, in many of the other young boys, united as they are in love of the lost boy, who thus becomes an almost Christian martyr, the one whose death brings love to all his friends. <br /><br />And so Dostoyevsky brings to a close his massive masterpiece, and so I end these little scribbles.",

    "text": "\u201cHurrah for Karamazov!\u201d<br /> <br />Those are the concluding words of this bombastic brick of a book. I am more than willing to chime in, to cheer for the brothers Karamazov who finally, finally made me give in to the genius of Dostoevsky fully, without anger, without resentment and fight, after a year of grappling with his earlier novels.<br /><br />This is doubtless his magnum opus, the shining lead star in a brilliant cosmos. There are many similarities to his earlier novels, and his characters fight with the same inner demons as the predecessors. And yet, there is something milder, more soothing in the Brothers Karamazov, there is mature perfection in this novel. <br /><br />Yes, Smerdyakov is an underprivileged, hateful sufferer, but he is not lost to compassion and care in the same way as the nihilistic man writing his <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/49455.Notes_from_Underground\" title=\"Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky\" rel=\"noopener\">Notes from Underground</a>. <br /><br />And Dimitri is rash and bold and full of contradictions, but he is not as confused as Raskolnikov, he does not impose the dogma of suffering in the sense of <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment\" title=\"Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky\" rel=\"noopener\">Crime and Punishment</a> on his family and community. He has a plan for living, not for suffering. <br /><br />Ivan is a brooding intellectual, but he is not stone-cold like Stavrogin in <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/3090348.Devils\" title=\"Devils by Fyodor Dostoyevsky\" rel=\"noopener\">Devils</a>. His conflicted heart and intellect are connected to the world.<br /><br />Alyosha, thank goodness, is a sweet and innocent character, but nothing like the awful Christlike idiot Myshkin from <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/12505.The_Idiot\" title=\"The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoyevsky\" rel=\"noopener\">The Idiot</a>. He knows how to live and interact, and he is willing to step away from rigid prejudices and principles to comfort the ones he loves. <br /><br />What about the women? Grushenka is not destroyed by the love of several men like Nastasya, and even Katerina Ivanovna is given a complex, divided soul, not just a shallow platform for men to use at their convenience and throw away when they have made their point. She has her own points to make.<br /><br />Why do the Brothers Karamazov work so well? <br /><br />I believe Dostoyevsky made the decision to paint a family just like it is, with all the contradictory emotions and actions, and all the mood swings and difficult situations. He had already established his religious and political ideas in earlier works, and he could afford to let the characters be what they naturally were, without judging them from the standpoint of history and society. Thus he could be the storyteller he naturally was, without any agenda but love for the story he told.<br /><br />The plot is both simple and complex: Be careful what you wish for, it might come true! <br /><br />As the three (or four) brothers and the women they love in different ways and fashions face the murder of the old patriarchal buffoon, all of them have to come to terms with the painful reality of loving and hating at the same time. <br /><br />A bad parent is still a parent, and a dead parent still has power over the lives of his offspring. The \u201cKaramazov character\u201d, much cited throughout the novel, becomes a synonym for any human being in his or her dealings with that complicated microcosm called family:<br /><br />\u201cAnd why? Because he was of the broad Karamazov character - that\u2019s just what I am leading up to - capable of combining the most incongruous contradictions, and capable of the greatest heights and of the greatest depths.\u201d<br /><br />Because Dostoyevsky dares to let go of his mission to prove that Russian nationalism and Christian orthodoxie are at the centre of the meaning of life, he actually makes a case for both in a much more convincing way than he ever could with his more concept- and idea-driven earlier works. The humour in the unforgettable scenes with the \u201cunspeakable conduct\u201d of the stinking Father Zossima are so much better than the pseudo-Christian rants of Myshkin, and the intellectual understanding of the dangers of community worship in the story of the Grand Inquisitor is as true now as it was back then, showing the way to the core of both religious and political extremism:<br /><br />\u201cThis craving for community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time. For the sake of common worship they\u2019ve slain each other with the sword. They have set up gods and challenged one another: Put away your gods and come and worship ours, or we will kill you and your gods.\u201d And so it will be to the end of the world, even when gods disappear from the earth; they will fall down before idols just the same.\u201d<br /><br />So what is the redeeming feature of the Karamazovs then? Why do I feel like shouting, over and over:<br /><br />\u201cHurrah for Karamazov!\u201d<br /><br />They love each other. They really do, in a crooked, angry way, in a distorted, strange way. But they do. They love each other despite being completely different in their approach to life, and they support each other\u2019s right to life, love and happiness. In the end, they help each other make the best of a muddle (and that is the best any family can do: help each other deal with the blows that families tend to inflict on themselves!).<br /><br />Exile in a place worse than Siberia (Oh, America, what a delightful irony Dimitri\u2019s words are!) is manageable if you make peace with your loved ones. And the final pages leave me bowing to the beauty of the insight that man and woman can love each other in so many different ways, and that love is not exclusive, but inclusive.<br /><br />Dostoyevsky! You wrote the perfect novel. Hurrah!",

Heck, I even have one of those home television sets that you so often hear about\u2026<br /><br /><i>The Brothers Karamazov </i> is by no means a galloping read. It is a whale of a novel that requires the reader to drop anchor and bob about on Fyodor's ocean of esteemed eloquence for as long as it takes. It was a slog at times and I'm ashamed to say that I almost jumped ship on many occasions.<br /><br />Dostoevsky threw everything but the kitchen sink at this, his <i>magnum opus</i>. He plucks random details from the alcoves of his mind and scatters them like confetti, and there are more characters here than you could wave a stick at. His imagery is vivid without being overdone, the writing is tight and beautifully paced. <br /><br />The story focuses on Fyodor Karamazov, a boorish and wicked father, and his three dissimilar sons. Collectively, the eponymous brothers are perhaps designed to represent all of us. Philosophical and theological discussions abound; the existence of God, morality and freedom of choice are the author's themes of choice. <br /><br />I certainly have no complaints about the writing, which is rich and expressive. Any quibbles I have say more about me as an easily-distracted reader than they do about Dostoevsky's incontestable skill as a writer. I dare say the novel would be a godsend to a bookworm who has chosen to live off-grid for a month. I don't know how long it took Dostoevsky to complete this, but his writing hand must surely have resembled a sloth's claw by the time he'd finished it!<br /><br />Does <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> harbour a captivating story to rival the likes of <i>Great Expectations</i> or <i>Les Mis\u00e9rables</i>?<br />I think not.<br /><br />Is this venerated novel worthy of the widespread admiration it receives?<br />Absolutely.",

    "text": "In 1929 Freud wrote that <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> was \u201cthe most magnificent novel ever written\u201d. Well, it\u2019s possible he had not got round to reading <i>Ulysses</i> yet (copies were hard to get until 1934) and of course he never did get the opportunity to read the work of Dan Brown or J K Rowling, but even so, this gives you the idea of this novel\u2019s impact on the brains of its readers. <br><br><b>A SUMMARY OF THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV</b><br><br>The major themes are<br><br>Comedy<br>Tragedy<br>Psychology<br>Politics<br>Theology<br>Life<br>Death<br>Drinking<br>Borrowing money<br><br><b>THIS NOVEL IS A SHAPESHIFTING BEAST</b><br><br>For chapters at a time this novel is about children. For most of the last half this novel is like a Richard Price police procedural (<i>Clockers, Freedomland, Lush Life</i>) and also like a great courtroom drama with verbatim closing speeches. Elsewhere it\u2019s a detailed debate about monastic life and the intricacies of the Christian message. The rest of the time it\u2019s an intense psychodrama between seven or eight major characters. In one chapter (\u201cAn Ailing Little Foot\u201d) Dosto prefigures Molly Bloom\u2019s stream of conscious. Got to say, this guy Dosto was not a one trick pony, not by a country mile. <br><br><b>SOME POINTS ABOUT 19TH CENTURY RUSSIA</b><br><br>Only peasants and servants work, leaving the rest of the people time to talk a lot<br><br>People are really ill quite often. This might be connected to the high alcohol consumption or the poor medical facilities<br><br>It is clear that the concept of <i>interrupting someone</i> had not yet been introduced into Russia at this point. So everyone is able to spout forth about anything they like, rambling on with multiple digressions for ten pages, and none of the other people in the room will say \u201coy, shut it, sunshine, we\u2019ve heard enough from you, let somebody else have a go\u201d. No one will say this. Eventually the speaker collapses to the floor from lack of oxygen and the next character will launch into their ten page rant. <br><br><b>THE NARRATOR IS A MAJOR CHARACTER</b><br><br>He is a bumbling old fart who lives in the little town where all this happens. He says he has gone round talking to people to get all this story straight. He continually says things like<br><i>The details I do not know \u2013 I have heard only that\u2026<br><br>I myself have not read the will<br><br>This arrival [of Ivan] which was so fateful and which was to serve as the origin of so many consequences for me long afterwards, the rest of my life, almost\u2026</i><br><br>And on P 573 he says <br><br><i>Today\u2019s item in the newspaper Rumours was entitled \u201cFrom Skotoprigonyevsk\u201d (alas, that is the name of our town, I have been concealing it all this time). </i><br><br><b>THERE ARE ZINGERS</b><br><br>You probably thought Dosto was a bit gloomy but this is often a comic novel, yes really. For instance Dmitri says<br><br><i>Who doesn\u2019t wish for his father\u2019s death ? \u2026Everyone wants his father dead</i><br><br>And the narrator himself comes out with<br><br><i>The two were some sort of enemies in love with each other</i><br><br>And Ivan says stuff like<br><br><i>When I think of what I would do to the man who first invented God! Stringing him up on the bitter asp would be too good for him. </i><br><br><b>THERE IS A MACGUFFIN</b><br><br>There is an amount of 3000 roubles that Dmitri borrows from his current squeeze, and readers had better get used to the phrase 3000 roubles popping up about three times on every other page of this 900 page novel. Because you see, totally co-incidentally, the dead father was robbed of this exact sum also. It can get slightly tiresome, I admit that. We never hear the last of it.<br><br><b>SOME BLURB WRITERS SHOULD BE STOPPED BEFORE THEY BLURB ANY MORE</b><br><br>The blurb on the back of my Penguin copy says<br><br><i>The murder of brutal landowner Fyodor Karamazov changes the lives of his sons</i> blah blah blah<br><br>This is likely to get readers all het up and their anticipation of a juicy whodunnit may turn to irritation because the murder doesn\u2019t happen until page 508. <i>This is not Dosto\u2019s fault. </i><br><br><br><b>ALL KARAMAZOV BROTHERS RATED</b><br><br>4.

You wouldn\u2019t want to be stuck in a lift with him. Not good boyfriend material.<br><br>3. Dmitri (a.k.a. Mitya, Mitka, Mitenka, Mitri) <br><br>This is the roister-doistering swaggering loudmouth uber-romantic aggravating jerk who because of his ability to drink ox-stunning amounts of hard liquor and then do the Argentinian tango or the Viennese waltz at the drop of a samovar is a wow with the ladies but you better be expecting to pay for his exhausting company because he never has a bean. Except that on the two occasions he does have a bean (3000 beans!) you will have <i>the best time ever!</i> Definitely not good boyfriend material.<br><br>2. Pavel Fyodorovich Smerdyakov (aka the lackey)<br><br>The unacknowledged bastard of Big Daddy Fyodor who is kept around as a skivvy and although he has brains because he\u2019s epileptic and an unacknowledged bastard is never given any education and therefore becomes an autodidact with a full tank of bloodcurdling homicidal suppressed rage.

    "text": "Contrary to widespread rumor, this is a far from bleak book. While every character has his or her own misery, and it all takes place in a place called something like \"cattle-roundup-ville\", the moments of religious ecstasy and moral clarity are heartbreaking in their frequency - it's hard not to wish that one had such bizarre events going on around one in order to prompt such lofty oratory.<br /><br />The story involves Ivan, Dmitri, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov, four brothers with a rich but notoriously lecherous father, Fyodor. All four brothers were raised by others, Fyodor having essentially ignored them until others removed them from his care. In the beginning of the book, Alyosha is in the monastery, studying under a famous elder name Father Zosima; Dmitri has just left the army and stolen a large sum of money from a government official's daughter, who he has also apparently seduced, all while pursuing a lawsuit against Fyodor for his inheritance and canoodling with his own father's intended, the local seductress Grushenka; Ivan, the intellectual in the family, has just returned from (I think) Petersburg. Dmitri is violent and impulsive, referring to himself as an \"insect,\" and gets into fistfights with Fyodor several times. Smerdyakov works for Fyodor as a lackey, having gone to France to learn to cook at some point in the past. It's unimaginably more complicated and digressive than all this, and just trying to follow this crucial sum of three thousand rubles through the story is almost impossible. But anyway, Fyodor is killed and much of the book hinges on which brother killed him and why. <br /><br />When I first read this book in high school, my teacher (who was a devout Catholic, a red-faced drunk who wore sunglasses to class, and the most enthusiastic reader of Russian literature imaginable) asked everyone who their favorite brother was. Was it Ivan, the tortured skeptic? Dmitri, the \"scoundrel\" who tortures himself for every wrong he commits but can't help committing more? Or Alyosha, the saintly one who always knows the right thing to say? (Certainly Smerdyakov is no one's favorite.) At the time I went with Ivan - I was in high school, after all, and his atheism and pessimism were revolutionary to me. <br /><br />But now Ivan seems rather selfish and callow, and I can't help siding with Dmitri, the one Dostoevsky uses almost as a case history of conscience. Like Shakespeare, Dostoevsky gives his characters all the space to talk like gods, clearing pages upon pages for their reasoning and dialog. Dmitri fumbles with Voltaire and is clearly not overly literate, but in some ways that's apropos, because his main problem is the constant internal conflict between his desires and his ethics which is only partly resolved when he chooses to become responsible for not only what he does, but also what he wants. <br /><br />The most famous passage in the book, Ivan's tale of the Grand Inquisitor, is, to me, far less interesting than Zosima's meditations on the conflict between justice and the collective good. The elder Zosima is a kind of Christian socialist who grapples with the typical mid-19th century Russian issues of how to build a equitable society without the extremes of coercion that the Tsar used to turn to, while also ensuring public morality and avoiding the kind of massacres that characterized the French Revolution (an event that seems to have been even more traumatizing for Russians than it was to the French due to the enormous cultural influence France had there at the time.) Zosima's answer is unworkable and in some ways naiive, but the discussion is well worth it, moreso than Ivan's somewhat simplistic dualism of Christ vs. the Inquisitor. Dostoevsky was a cultural conservative in the sense that he was constantly renewing his commitment to the obligations imposed on Russians by the Orthodox Church. At the same time, he was committed to the pursuit of joy through kindness and community and a kind of interpersonal fair dealing in a way that transcends his political concerns and is inspiring to see articulated in the lives of people who are as confused as the rest of us.<br /><br />It's a huge, messy book, but so worth the effort. It took me about three months to read carefully, though my reading has been flagging lately, as well. I read this while listening to Hubert Dreyfus's accompanying lectures at Stanford on existentialism and this book which are available on iTunes U, and even when I felt his readings overreached, it was a good way to reread a tough and subtle work like this.

    "text": "It's not hard to understand Nabokov's objections to Dostoevsky. It's his scruffiness as a novelist Nabokov with his literary sartorial elegance would have objected to. For example, his gun-ho attitude towards unnecessary repetition. And also his occasional lapses at organising his material for maximum dramatic effect, most evident in the construction of the trial. Nabokov was much more of a literary dandy than Dostoevsky, much more self-conscious, much more vigilant in his attention to detail, more subtle and ingenious in his artistry. But Dostoevsky was more courageous and pioneering psychologically. More intimate with the dark and unearthed side of the human condition. Nabokov was always looking for the laugh; Dostoevsky was more drawn to the accelerated heartbeat, the rush of blood to the head.<br /> <br />Dostoevsky's closest ally as a novelist is probably Emily Bronte. I thought while reading this that it's literature's greatest tragedy that Emily never got to write another novel. It's almost a complete mystery what she might have come up with. Like Emily, he dramatizes in the outer world the illicit promptings of the shadow self. Like Emily, he knows only a thin layer of cerebral paint shields us all from violence and horror. Like Emily, he's not the least interested in life's civilised arrangements, the house and garden existence. And they both mirror Shakespeare in this regard. Characters nakedly put the entirety of their being into every dramatic moment. Character is always fate. <br /><br /> The brothers are simplistically split into single imperatives of the human psyche: Alyosha is spirit/innocence, Mitya is sensuality and Ivan is intellect. Each of the brothers allow D to enter a different milieu of society. Aloysha surrounds himself with children and monks; Mitya with loose women and dissolute men; Ivan with progressive thinkers. You might say the three brothers combined are presented as an everyman. As always with D, his women, though relegated to background roles (historically accurate you'd have to say for the most part), are fascinating creations. This was especially evident to me as I was reading Michael Chabon at the same time whose women as a rule tend to be kind of perfunctory and less than vivid or nuanced or compelling as dramatic presences, often having no independent life outside their relationships with their men. D's women on the other hand blaze with frustrated independent aspiration. <br /><br />I marvelled at the idiosyncrasies of my memory while reading this. Though I've read it twice my memory withheld all the central plot coordinates, yet I could recall various scenes as vividly as if they were a part of my own life. Made me think of Proust whose narrator seems to remember what we consider incidental details of his life rather than the big picture landmarks. There's clearly a lot of truth in this perspective.<br /><br />I read a professional review of this which put forward the idea that Aloysha didn't interest Dostoevsky. I'd say this is utter baloney. For starters, the novel always benefits from his presence. He provides warmth and empathy. And then his narratives are often the most compelling - his flirtatious relationship with Lize or with the dying boy or with Zosima the elder for example. ",

And avoid contempt, both of others and of yourself: what seems bad to you in yourself is purified by the very fact that you have noticed it in yourself. And avoid fear, though fear is simply the consequence of every lie.</i> (57)</blockquote>\t<br />Family. You cannot pick. You are either happy to be around them or you are stuck with them. You can choose your friends, a pet, you can choose between a blueberry muffin and a chocolate chip one, but you cannot choose your family. The combination of genetics and the social environment is simply fascinating. For example, take this ordinary Russian family. An ambitious, lascivious, ridiculous father who enjoyed alcohol in any form; a son who, at first, seemed to be the image of his father; a second son, vain and intellectual with even more questionable moral reactions; the youngest son with the kindness of a saint and the troubled soul of a common man and another weak, disturbing young man who never counted as a son. This book contains the story of every family in the world. Their struggles, their fears, their doubts, the decisions that reflect the highest and most degrading aspects of human nature.<br /><blockquote><b>\u201cThere is a force that will endure everything,\u201d said Ivan, this time with a cold smirk.<br />\u201cWhat force?\u201d<br />\u201cThe Karamazov force ... the force of the Karamazov baseness.\u201d<br />\u201cTo drown in depravity, to stifle your soul with corruption, is that it?\u201d</b> (210)</blockquote><br />This book contains centuries of human history. It is a major treatise on philosophy and religion. And yes, there is a lot of religion here, but even me, a person who is struggling with a lack of faith and a deep ocean of doubts and fear, can still be interested and dazzled by all this. (Unless we are talking about the \"monk book\". There were a couple of good things but, in general, it was the only part of the book that made me want to take a really long nap. I must admit it, in the spirit of full disclosure. And my previous naive defense about how \u201ceven\u201d me could be interested? Yes, forget it, I know I am haunted by uncertainty and, therefore, obsessed with knowledge, no matter how limited I can be.)<br /><br /><blockquote><b>\u201cCan it be that you really hold this conviction about the consequences of the exhaustion of men\u2019s faith in the immortality of their souls?\u201d the elder suddenly asked Ivan Fyodorovich.<br />\u201cYes, it was my contention. There is no virtue if there is no immortality.\u201d<br />\u201cYou are blessed if you believe so, or else most unhappy!\u201d<br />...<br />\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right... ! But still, I wasn't quite joking either ... ,\u201d Ivan Fyodorovich suddenly and strangely confessed\u2014by the way, with a quick blush.<br />\u201cYou weren't quite joking, that is true. This idea is not yet resolved in your heart and torments it. But a martyr, too, sometimes likes to toy with his despair, also from despair, as it were. For the time being you, too, are toying, out of despair, with your magazine articles and drawing-room discussions, without believing in your own dialectics and smirking at them with your heart aching inside you ... The question is not resolved in you, and there lies your great grief, for it urgently demands resolution...\u201d</b> (66)</blockquote><br />A sharp observation written using such an exquisite language. You should become accustomed to that. Once you reach Book V, you will found yourself overwhelmed by the author's mesmerizing erudition.<br /><br />If you're expecting an explosive plot with lots of things going on at the same time, weird twists and vampires, fights and dragons, magic and flying dogs, then this book is not for you. There is a plot, of course, but the excellence of this book lies on the writing. Dostoyevsky's trademark is his gifted ability to describe human nature using the most poignantly elegant prose known to man. His insightful points of view on almost every subject that affects all humanity are written with admirable lyricism and precision. Reading this particular writer can be rather demanding. You have to be prepared. You have to become habituated to the idea that your soul might absorb the despairing and sometimes playful beauty of his writing. And once that happens, you won't be able to forget him. Dostoyevsky has the power to defeat oblivion. He personifies an unwelcome light that illuminates every dark nook of our minds. He makes us think about what we like to see in ourselves and what we choose to hide.<br /><blockquote><b>Jealousy! \u201cOthello is not jealous, he is trustful\u201d... A truly jealous man is not like that. It is impossible to imagine all the shame and moral degradation a jealous man can tolerate without the least remorse. And it is not that they are all trite and dirty souls. On the contrary, it is possible to have a lofty heart, to love purely, to be full of self-sacrifice, and at the same time to hide under tables, to bribe the meanest people, and live with the nastiest filth of spying and eavesdropping... And one may ask what is the good of a love that must constantly be spied on, and what is the worth of a love that needs to be guarded so intensely? </b>(293)</blockquote> <br />Besides briefly discussing the plot, I can only add I don't have favorite characters. They all annoyed me or disgusted me in the same contradictory way. But I do understand them, most of the times. I loved the dialogues\u2014the amazing reflections while they are deciding to act against everything that is good; they know what they are about to do is wrong but they can't help it; it's in their blood\u2014the profound remarks of our narrator and the fact that Dostoyevsky, one more time, allowed me to enter inside his characters' minds. He shares the complexity of all of them. And I'm enchanted by this man's ability to make everything beautiful, even while describing the darkest aspects of humanity, which leads me to another point.<br />I love reading other people's thoughts on the books I like. A certain opinion I read a while ago was about how Dostoyevsky seems to be a vicious misogynist because of the way he wrote about Smerdyakov's mother, \u201cStinking Lizaveta.\u201d I try not to make out of every word written by the author, a reflection of the person he or she really is. Crime writers don't usually murder every human they find. Mystery writers don't always think that somebody's butler is up to something. In that sense, an author who writes about how a woman is mistreated by a certain part of society doesn't necessarily mean he's a vicious misogynist. He was being honest, he was displaying truth. Poor women and men were often treated like less than a human - that hasn't changed that much. Dostoyevsky described it too vividly.*<br /><blockquote><b>...people speak sometimes about the \u2018animal\u2019 cruelty of man, but that is terribly unjust and offensive to animals, no animal could ever be so cruel as a man, so artfully, so artistically cruel.</b> (193)</blockquote><br />In conclusion, as I said before, this book contains the history of the world. A deluge of misery and wisdom waiting for the reader. The way of representing the Russian soul is the way all souls should be represented; it transcends any geographical boundary, any limitation of time. We all have many sides of the Karamazovs' nature in us. We all have demons tormenting our good judgment. We all know what we should do and, sometimes, we simply can't do it. I can't justify everything but we are humans. I want to understand, I need to. We are susceptible to failure. To negligence. To vileness, dishonesty and many other abhorrent things. Once mistakes are made, only the most fortunate ones are able to find a path toward redemption. In this book, in this Russia which portrays the world of all times, some did. And some had to endure the bitter punishments that the choices in their lives have brought upon them.<br /><blockquote><b>\u2018I love mankind,\u2019 he said, \u2018but I am amazed at myself: the more I love mankind in general, the less I love people in particular, that is, individually, as separate persons...</b> (56)</blockquote><br />Too human. We all hear the sounds of a ravenous solitude echoing in the dark depths of our beings; they often make us act by instinct, forgetting that we have been blessed\u2014or doomed\u2014with reason. Moreover, they make us forget to feel love. And that, indeed, is a faithful depiction of what hell must feel like. A hell to which we will soon arrive by repeating to ourselves: <i>\n  <b>everything is permitted</b>\n</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />May 05, 14-Update June 17, 19<br />*Just another reader's opinion.<br />** Also on <a href=\"https://nonbookreviews.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">my blog.</a>",

    "text": "\u201cThe Brothers Karamazov\u201d has intrigued me for years. I have always been aware of the fact that it is one of the greatest novels ever written so I know I have to read it eventually. Finally, after reading it, I think I get why this is considered great literature-- and though I can't exactly say that I loved it, I admit that I don\u2019t regret reading it. <br /><br />The plot revolves around the murder of perhaps one of the most despicable characters ever created, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov, the father of the Karamazov brothers. This detail about the book only skims the surface because this only serves as the basic architecture for Dostoevsky's philosophy. This novel isn't so much a story as: a lengthy dissertation on human nature; the issues of Dostoyevsky's day; detailed personality profiles; and digressions on every subject the author wanted to pursue, including free will, the existence of God, moral responsibility, and truth. <br /><br />It's a high-minded novel full of weighty intellectual themes and Dostoevsky\u2019s skill is unquestionable. \u201cThe Grand Inquisitor\u201d is a supremely strange chapter , and one of the most unique things I\u2019ve read in literature. The courtroom drama at the end of the novel, would be very hard to match in modern fiction. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"ef8ddcda-19b3-41bd-bc09-ec852d104d6b\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"ef8ddcda-19b3-41bd-bc09-ec852d104d6b\"> In particular, the defense attorney\u2019s closing argument is remarkable for its command of human psychology, as the hired gun from St. Petersburg shows that all the supposedly incriminating circumstances of the case can be understood. </label> <br />And of the family\u2014what a family! Each figure in this household (?) embodies conflicting phases of the author\u2019s great ideas: Fyodor Karamazov, the father, is a sensualist of the lowest type imaginable; Dmitri inherits his father\u2019s passions but is tempered by periods of misgiving; Ivan is a materialist and a cynic. He changes his mind after a severe illness, and his materialistic belief is replaced by intense spiritual curiosity; Alyosha is an idealist, lovable and loving. Dostoevsky\u2019s discordant elements are effectively conveyed in his human characterizations.<br /><br />That said, \u201cThe Brothers Karamazov\u201d still didn\u2019t impress me as much as I expected it to. The story started out painfully slow. In my opinion, a great novel shouldn't require readers to force themselves to stay awake for more than 1/4 of the book in order to become acquainted with initially uninteresting characters. As with the rest of the book, there were many points where Dostoevsky seemed to descend into meaningless details that, to me, did nothing to advance the plot, atmosphere, or characterization. <br />I feel that the author is disconnected from his audience, and he doesn't seem to care. This comes to a point where I think Dostoevsky frequently loses himself in the meshes of his own word spinning. The book goes off too many tangents and is densely verbose. <br />I found pages of extraordinary depth and poignancy but they are few and far in between. I find it hard to connect with any of the characters since their personalities are diluted by the manic and morbidly intense verbal flow. Half the book was one of the Karamazovs talking on and on, uninterrupted to an audience as silent and passive as the reader. I frequently spaced out and have to backtrack. I eventually found myself reading this book in a grim desire to finish it and be done, rather than out of a sense of enjoyment.<br />I admired author's insights into human nature, but all too often, he seemed to make grand proclamations arbitrarily that have little evidence behind them. As if by declaring them with confidence he somehow made them true beyond question. And for whatever unaccountable reason, his preoccupations landed like a relic in my own life. My feelings can be aptly described by Rosewater\u2019s words in Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s \u201cSlaughterhouse Five\u201d:<br /><br /><i>\u201cThere is one other book, that can teach you everything you need to know about life... it's The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, but that's not enough anymore.\u201d</i><br /><br />I still think it\u2019s worth the read, and there is always something to be earned from reading the books of great authors who influenced other great authors. And besides, no matter what my opinion is, Ol\u2019 Dusty is still going strong!",

    "text": "I finished reading this book at precisely 0205 hours today. The night still lay majestically over the impending dawn, and in its blackened stillness, swayed the echoes of this imperious book. The walls of my room, at once, turned into a fortress for Dostoevsky\u2019s army of thoughts, and I, right in the middle of it, found myself besieged with its diverse, haphazard but mighty blizzard. <br /><br />I am no stranger to this rambling Russian\u2019s precocious visions and forbearance and yet, and yet, this work, swells much beyond even his own creator and spills over\u2026. well, almost, <i>everything</i>. <br /><br />A maniacal land-owner is murdered and one of his three sons is the prime suspect. Thus, ensues a murder trial and in its fold, fall hopelessly and completely, the lives of all the three brothers \u2013 the brothers Karamazov. <br /><br />A life, when spans a trajectory both long and substantial, ends up writing a will that is both personal and universal. A notebook of reflections, a source of knowledge, an oasis of love and a mirror of perpetuity. And may I dare say that for D, this might well be a biography, which he, in his quintessential mercurial satire, chose to write himself, under the garb of fiction.<br /><br />Dmitri, Ivan and Alyosha present the very tenets on which life gets lived, or even more, passed on. The impulsive and emotional Dmitri, the calculative and intelligent Ivan and the na\u00efve and spiritual Alyosha represent the microcosm of a society which wagers war on the name of religion, status, power, values and ideals. And D takes each of these causes and drills, and drills, and drills even more, their various interpretations. <br /><br />Religion, and church, take centre stage for a good 350 pages of this work. Amid homilies and confessions, monasteries and surrender, is pushed disturbing ideals that can rock one\u2019s faith.<i>\n  <blockquote>If you are surrounded by spiteful and callous people who do not want to listen to you, fall down before them and ask for their forgiveness, for the guilt is yours too, that they do not want to listen to you. And if you cannot speak with the embittered, serve them silently and in humility, never losing hope. And if everyone abandons you and drives you out by force, then, when, you are left alone fall down on the earth and kiss it and water it with your tears, and the earth will bring forth fruit from your tears, even though no one has seen or heard you in your solitude.</blockquote>\n</i>Aye, aye, I hear you, D and while some of it makes so much sense to my theist heart, some of it look outright suicidal. But why again, am I tempted to always, measure the righteousness, even lesser, the likeability, of my action from the perspective of my audience? Why make an ideal on a bed that doesn\u2019t smell of <i>my</i> skin? I go to the board and think. <br /><br />Philosophising, as he does with such ease and amiability, isn\u2019t without unleashing a thundering dose of dichotomies. He steals the mirror from my room and turns it towards me: 'Oh, so you believe in the good? How nice! But, well, then, how come the devil lurks in the dark corners of your room? No? You don\u2019t agree with me? Oh where does all the cursing and ill-will spring from that you aim, with such precise ferocity, towards the people you don\u2019t quite find to your liking? From where does all the impiety and malice, that you secretly drink with panache, emerge from leaving you intoxicated for hours, if not days?' Sheepishly, I dig the chalk a little deeper into the board, and think.<br /><br />And while I grope to find answers to his questions, I cheat and fall back on his treatise for hints, and insights.<i>\n  <blockquote>You know, Lise, it\u2019s terribly difficult for an offended man when everyone suddenly starts looking like his benefactor.</blockquote>\n</i>Why might a fallen man, a beggar, still keep a flame of dignity burning in his heart? Why might a harangued father, drive away his heirs from money, while spending his whole life hoarding for them? Why might a pauper, throw away his last penny on trifles, despite carrying a clear picture of his imminent doom in his eyes? Why might a pure heart, deliberately dirty his soul with pungent secrets, knowing there were no ways to erase them? Because deep down, what bind us, irrespective of our backgrounds, are the same threads: love, jealousy, ambition, hatred, revenge, repentance. In various forms, they dwell in us, and drive us, to give their formless matter, shape in different people, in different ways, at different places and in different times. I write a few words on the board and pause to ponder. <br /><br />But, make no mistake; D turns the mirror on himself too and takes digs on his own character, because, after all, what life have we lived if we didn\u2019t learn to laugh at ourselves? Laugh, yes; ah yes! There is plenty of humor ingrained, albeit surreptitiously, in this dense text and works like a lovely whiff of cardamom wafting over a cup of strong tea.<i>\n  <blockquote>Ivan Fyodorovich, my most respectful son, allow me to order you to follow me!</blockquote>\n</i>There, I made a smiley on the board. I dropped the chalk and wondered: what created so much debate (and furore perhaps) when this book was first published in the 19th century? And then, I realized \u2013 even without my knowledge, my fingers had imparted two horns to the smiley\u2019s rotund face. Yes, now <i>that image</i> surely needs to be questioned. <br /><br />But do ask these questions. Do take the plunge into this deep sea of psychology and philosophy. Do feel the thuds of paradoxes and dualities on your soul. Do allow the unknown elements of orthodoxy and modernism to pucker your skin. Do allow some blood to trickle. Do allow some scars to heal. Because <i>\n  <blockquote>No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their Hamlets, but so far we have only Karamazovs!\u201d</blockquote>\n</i>That\u2019s what!<br /><br />---<br /><br /><i>\n  <a href=\"https://fleetingbrook.wordpress.com/2017/05/26/book-review-the-brothers-karamazov-by-fyodor-dostoevsky-1880/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Also on my blog.</a>\n</i>",

    "text": "I have read this book three or four times in both English and French translations. In English, grab the Volonhovsky one. I cannot even begin to describe how awesome this book is. If for no other reason than Ivan's two chapters and especially for the Grand Inquisitor, this book is clearly in the upper reaches of the greatest literature ever written in any language. The range of personalities, emotions, and reactions of the various characters - all so fully developed and realistic in that specific Dostoyevsky way - makes the plot move along so very quickly. One's sympathies shift as we vilify Fyodor and idolise Aliosha at first but then we start to feel a bit sorry for Fyodor and resent Aliosha's na\u00efvet\u00e9 as we learn about Misha and Ivan...<br /><br />There is just so much in this novel to love. This is one of those desert-island books without which the human race would be poorer.<br /><br />Also highly recommended is Joseph Frank's excellent biography of Dostoyevski if you wish to understand why this book was his last and his greatest.<br /><br />Ivan's chapters about unbaptized children and The Grand Inquisitor are among the greatest chapters I have ever read, absolutely spell-binding and critical for today's world of \"alternative facts\" and disdain of objectivity.<br /><br />Just finished this again, but in audio format.

I honestly am not capable of discriminating.</em>\n</p><br />The book is not about the murder or about who did it, those things were very apparent before half the book was completed - the narrator taking special pains to spoil all suspense for his readers at the very beginning (harkening back to the days of greek drama and <a title=\"Euripides\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Euripides</a> - according to whom, the effect of a story, even a\u00a0whodunnit, was not in epic suspense about what was going to happen next, but in those great scenes of lyrical rhetorics in which the passion and dialectic of the protagonists reached heights of eloquence. Everything was to portend pathos, not action, which was always there only as a container for the pathos, to give it form). <br /><br />This was probably done so that the typical clue-seeking\u00a0aspects of a mystery does not detract his reader from\u00a0addressing\u00a0the real, the painful questions littered all across his treatise, almost with indecent abandon. <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler.

And do not forget that <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3137322.Fyodor_Dostoyevsky\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dostoyevsky</a>\u00a0even gave us the alternate route that Mitya could have taken in the Zosima\u00a0narrative\u00a0- the parallels in that story are too numerous to list out here.</label><br /><br />No, this story is not about the murder, or about the murderer, or about his motivations, or around the suspense surrounding his final fate. The story is about the reaction - it was all about the jury. <br /><br /><b>Many theories abound about how the Karamazov family represents Russia/humanity/all characters but the reality is that they represent individualities; while it is that terrible\u00a0faceless\u00a0jury, always addressed to and never addressed by, that represents humanity.</b> The job of the country, the society, of the whole human race is to judge, to determine the fate of\u00a0individuals\u00a0based on the stories that they construct, literally out of thin air, out of the small pieces of a life that they can only ever observe. The best character sketches, fictional or\u00a0otherwise\u00a0can only ever be the minutest portion of a real character - but from that tiniest of slivers we build this\u00a0ambiguous\u00a0thing called \u2018character\u2019, as if such a thing can possibly exist for a creature as\u00a0fickle-minded\u00a0and forgetful of\u00a0himself\u00a0as man. <br /><br />Character of a man is the greatest myth,\u00a0propagated\u00a0best by\u00a0novelists, as no story can proceed without a \u2018constant\u2019 man who behave with some level of\u00a0predictability\u00a0or with predictable\u00a0unpredictability, but real life is the result of adding a minimum of three more \u2018unpredictable\u2019 as adjectives to that earlier description, to come close to describing even the simplest and most boring idiot alive. But yet we construct stories, to understand, to predict, to know how to behave, we even make up stories about\u00a0ourselves\u00a0so that we may have an illusion of control over who we are - so that we do not melt into the\u00a0amorphous\u00a0protean\u00a0mass that is the rest of humanity - my story\u00a0separates\u00a0me from all of them. <br /><br /><b>I construct, therefore I am.</b><br /><br />These are the romances that Dostoevsky\u00a0wields\u00a0his best work against and the trial is a trial of reason, of reality pitted against the overwhelming\u00a0circumstantial\u00a0evidence in\u00a0favor\u00a0of romance, of the myth of character, of individuality, of cause and effect, of there being anything predictable when such a wild variable as a human mind is part of the equation, how can such an equation be anything but \u2018indeterminate\u2019 (to\u00a0borrow Dostoevsky\u2019s own expression)?<br /><br /><b>That was the grand trial, the\u00a0inquisition\u00a0of reason.</b><br /><br />But how can the\u00a0defense\u00a0stand up in\u00a0favor\u00a0of reality without explaining to the jury (to humanity) why they see things not as they are, that they have made up a story that is perfect but is never real as no story can ever be - as no cause can\u00a0really\u00a0cause a\u00a0definite\u00a0effect when human beings are\u00a0involved? You have to tell a story to convince the jury. You have to tell a story to defend the fact that stories do not exist. A story now, about stories. Or multiple stories to show how all stories are false if only one can be allowed to be true. The only other option is that all are true,\u00a0simultaneously. By proving which you include your own story in that \u2018self-consuming\u2019 super-set and doom your own argument. <b>There is the irresolvable conflict of the trial, of the story, of the novel, of life.</b><br /><br />You cannot discredit the myth of the story without the help of a story as the jury that\u00a0judges\u00a0cannot understand, cannot comprehend any reality\u00a0outside\u00a0of a story, human beings cannot think outside their romances. <b>They will continue to exist as prisoners to their own stories.</b> That is why it is a comedy and not a tragedy, as no one died and no one killed and it remains akin to a\u00a0sphinx setting us a riddle which he cannot solve himself.\u00a0But,\u00a0judgment\u00a0had to be\u00a0passed\u00a0as the story was told.<br /><br />One story among many.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--------<br /><br />An expanded review <em>might</em> follow and will try to address some of the big themes of the book, enumerated below:<br /><br />1) <strong>On Fatherhood</strong> - The second big theme of the book.

So, in the end his alternate vision of Satan\u2019s court is what was really shown by the current judicial apparitions?

Christ or Humanity, Satan or Church, Dimitri or Russia?<br /><br />3) <strong>On Collateral Damage</strong>\u00a0- inflicted by the main story on side stories, on how the small side stories are over shadowed, no murdered by the main one and without any risk of conviction.<br /><br />4) <strong>On the Institution of Religion</strong>- On morality and the question of the\u00a0necessity\u00a0of religion; On the basis for faith; On the implications of faith/lack of faith to the story one tells about oneself; On how <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/284799602\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Philip Pullman</a> took the easy way out by expanding\u00a0Dostoevsky\u2019s story for his widely acclaimed novel; On the enormous burden of free will; On the\u00a0dependence\u00a0of men on the security of miracles that is the source of all hell and of all action.<br /><br />5) <strong>On the Characters</strong> - On how Dostoevsky\u00a0took the cream of his best-conceived characters from the universe of his creation, from across all his best works to populate his <em>magnum opus</em>, his story about stories, to trace out their path with the ultimate illusion of realism, with the ultimate ambition and to show/realize how it should always, always fall apart; On how he reflected the whole universe in a small lake and created a novel about all novels, disproving and affirming them simultaneously, murdering its own parents in its own fulfillment; On how they might have\u00a0their\u00a0Hamlets, but we have our Karamazov's.<br /><br />6) <strong>On Hope &amp; Redemption</strong> - On how ultimately Zosima's world view trumps the cynical aspects that dominated the book; On how Zosima predicted it all at the very\u00a0beginning\u00a0and apologized to Dimitri on behalf of all mankind - \u2018taking everyone\u2019s sin upon\u00a0himself\u201d, thus creating an inverted reflection of the christ figure, its image playing on both Dimitri and on Zosima for that split second and then passing on to Alyosha\u00a0until\u00a0finally projected back to Dimitri, in the ultimate paradox, where he becomes at last a christ figure and a buddha figure, exemplifying self-knowledge and\u00a0enlightenment\u00a0through true suffering; On how even the Karamazov name can be inspiring and be cause for cheers even though it represents the worst (best?) of\u00a0humanity;\u00a0On The Sermon at the Stone.<br /><br />7)<strong> On\u00a0</strong><strong>Nihilism</strong>\u00a0- On the absurdity of life and trying to explain it. But oh wait, this is what I talked of in paragraph length already.<br /><br />\u00a0<br /><br />\u00a0<br /><br />PS. By the way, when you read this, keep your ears tuned towards the end - for somewhere in the distance you might hear the laugh of the Grand\u00a0Inquisitor\u00a0echoing faintly.",

    "text": "This book is one of the most challenging ones to review. And if I consider myself capable of such a venture, it will still take pages to write a proper review that would do justice to the book. So my attempt here is only to share my perspective as best as I can. :)<br /><br />I've heard that <i>The Karamazov Brothers</i> is the best work of Dostoyevsky. It may be premature for me to comment on such a conclusion, I can well understand why it is so praised. It is a book complete in every aspect: in writing, in storytelling, in character development, and the plotline. Being a book with over 1000 pages, I was a little apprehensive at the beginning. But his undemanding writing put me at ease from the very first chapter. <br /><br />The book is a crime story as well as a philosophical and religious debate. All parts were brilliantly done and extremely interesting. But what connected me with this extraordinary work is its character development. Almost all the major characters of the book are taken through a rough journey that tests their strengths and weaknesses and helps them to come to understand themselves, their faith, and their beliefs. <br /><br />Alyosha is the supposed hero, chosen by Dostoevsky himself. But I found an equal hero in Ivan. I loved them both. They are the two major contrasting characters in the story: one a believer and the other a non-believer (atheist). Their contrasting views added depth to the story. <br /><br />All the characters had their virtues and faults which made them real and believable. Throughout the read, I felt like a part of their community. Dostoyevsky's beautiful and heartfelt writing utterly captivated me and I was completely immersed in the world of the Karamazovs. <br /><br /><i>The Karamazov Brothers</i> is the sort of the book that will become a part of yourself, and which will live and age with you. That is the true quality of a masterpiece. It is a true blessing to come across such a beautiful work of literature. I feel so privileged.",

But the exhaustion is like the exhaustion of sex (can\u2019t find more fitting analogy) breathless and full of life at the same. Like the traveler who was long gone on a journey and on his return, bathes for a long good hour, taking good care of every little pore of body, soaping himself as he sinks in tub very slowly, and as water pours over him he shuts his eyes and with numbing senses recalls everything in an episodic manner, the tiniest details of his journey, and that\u2019s the magic of Dostoyevsky, his reader is exasperated by the far off tours but at the end, is exalted nonetheless! <br />The hell we create through our thoughts for ourselves, is never been better visited by any other but D.the endless war we are in with ourselves, the fluctuations of our mind, the contradictions of our ideas and creation of ideals, the conflict of God or no God, the choice of being sinner or saint, is all in us, within us, and Dostoyevsky leaves nothing unsaid in telling the tale of who we are, and what we choose to hide, the characteristic quality of his prose is directness, he sometimes, undoubtedly descends to the elegant, but his element is great. He occasionally invests himself to an extent, but his natural port is human psychology.<br />\u201cJe pense, donc je suis, I know that for a fact, all the rest, all these worlds, God and even Satan\u2014all that is not proved, to my mind. Does all that exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of myself, a logical development of my ego which alone has existed forever?\u201d (p. 781)<br />Brother Karamazov is not the tale to be taken as a chronicle of one family and parricide only, the murder is not a mystery here, neither is the murderer, it\u2019s all known at the instant murder takes place, or even before, the plethora of themes and thoughts runs deep in the waters of this gigantic ocean that the volume is! We have in detail, the characters donned into garbs of confused expressions about other characters and on the brink of self-assessment and self-denial. And as the novel proceeds, there are peculiar ideas, echoing into the minds of characters, ideas get doubled or split into multiple strings as the tale follows, Dostoyevsky makes his characters suffer by their own doomed states, their own beings are their torture cells, no one escapes this suffering, no one!<br />The question of individual identity mounts many a time in the story, as the devil visits Ivan or so he fancies; the boundaries of one soul and the influence of wishes thought to be unvoiced are questioned throughout the novel, the suppressed/unidentified wishes of one character are accomplished by the other, For instance, the relationship between Ivan and Smerdyakov, with Ivan apparently the stronger and more intelligent, and Smerdyakov the instrument of his will. Ivan\u2019s unconscious wishes for his father\u2019s death direct Smerdyakov, who communicates with the unconscious directly; Smerdyakov is, then, the master, the controller of fate simply because he is able to penetrate the barrier of consciousness that must conventionally deny evil impulses.<br />We are quite restrained to admit the bastard smerdykov shrewder than Iven, he is cleverer and is more strategic with his nihilistic views, and the self-centered epileptic is astonishingly strongest of the characters, he proves through actions that \u201call the things are lawful\u201d<br />Ah! How cold he is to lay us stark naked before us, we\u2019ve long known his brother Karamazov, we are them, if not wholly, but in parts, the impulsive, goodhearted Dimitri is recognizable to us like a closed kin,we know Ivan, the skeptic genius and we\u2019ve been him too in our hearts, haunted by uncertainty, tormented by conscience....<br />\u201cDo you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted? Without it, I am told, man could not have existed on earth, for he could not have known good and evil. Why should he know that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole world of knowledge is not worth that child\u2019s prayer to \u2018dear, kind God\u2019!\u201d (p. 287)",

    "text": "I will generally finish a novel no matter what...but I could not push through this one. I have tried twice, so I suppose this is going to be a novel that doesn't ever make it to my \"read\" list.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE:</b> It took me three starts and an unusual amount of determination to finish this novel. I was inches away from abandoning it for good and all. I am glad I didn\u2019t, but believe me when I say I hope I never encounter a book this hard to endure again in my reading lifetime.<br /><br />The themes Dostoevsky tackles along the way are significant and weighty. Just when he begins to move the story forward, he always seems to stop and write a few chapters of political or religious philosophy, and the reader is required to stop with him, digest what the arguments mean, and weigh in personally on which side of the debate truth lies. The book inspires soul searching, but requires almost inhuman concentration.<br /><br />The brothers themselves are atypical characters, volatile and impassioned, unpredictable and complicated. Nothing they do seems to be logical. Even Alyosha, who is easily understood to be the \u201cgood\u201d brother, behaves sometimes in a way that is puzzling to my non-Russian mind. The father is a buffoon, and so crude and cruel that he garners no sympathy from me at all.<br /><br />Over half way in, I feel that I do not care what happens to a single character here and that at least 90% of what has occurred makes no real sense. Then, things begin to gel, the story begins to move, I find myself caring about what happens to these men, particularly Dmitri (Mitya) and to the two women with whom he is involved. I know I will make it through this time.<br /><br />I understand why this is considered an important work and a classic piece of literature. It addresses many important issues that have universal implications. What happens if you remove God from the equation? What purpose does faith serve in life? Does suffering lead to self-awareness and can it change a man for the better? To what extent are we morally responsible for others? If you wish a murder, if you fail to stop one, are you equally guilty with the man who commits the deed? <br /><br />I suspect I will be pondering The Brothers Karamazov for a long while. I did not enjoy this read, but it will mean something to me. Perhaps, like Mitya, I needed to suffer to attain appreciation. At the very least, I have come away with a sense of accomplishment. Now for something very, very, very light.<br /><br /><br />",

    "text": "I have always been an optimist (!). I must have been 12 when a family friend gave me a $50 gift card for a bookstore close to my house. Imagine that. $50, all for me, books. So obviously the first thing I did was run to the store and blow a good chunk of that money on two books: <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> and <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>. I am now 25. In the 13 years that have passed since then, I have \u201ctried\u201d to read <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> 4 times. The first 3 times ended up 50 pages in. I had the same set of excuses that I would throw around, usually having nothing to do with my inherent lack of maturity and having everything to do with Russian names, nicknames, patronymics, etc. Russian books are depressing! Why would I read them? I would never stop to think \u201cOkay, if you <i>truly</i> believe in that reasoning, stop trying.\u201d That makes too much sense of course. The 4th and final unsuccessful attempt came when I was beginning my graduate studies. I had actually made it 100 pages in. Then life happened, and it happened hard. Grad school, I guess. What happened, then, to push me to be successful this 5th (and by <i>no means</i> final) attempt? My dad picked it up, read it, then proceeded to tell me that he had read it constantly, knowing it would motivate me to get there. Fathers and Sons. Thanks dad. Very cool.<br><br>I\u2019m not quite sure if this one needs me to say much about influence, impact, literary weight, etc. We all know. There is a reason I kept trying to read it as a young\u2019un. The name is in the culture, and we most likely drift through our lives as readers knowing that the book has a certain aura around it. There is the famous Freud quote that comes up with this book \u2013 \u201cthe most magnificent novel ever written.\u201d This was the book that was on Tolstoy\u2019s bedside table as he died. Joseph Frank, a famous Dostoyevsky scholar, says that the book has \u201ca grandeur that spontaneously evokes comparison with the greatest creations of Western literature. <i>The Divine Comedy</i>, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, <i>Faust</i> - these are the titles that naturally come to mind as one tries to measure the stature of <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>.\u201d<br><br>As you read the book for the first time, you are taking in a great number of ideas \u2013 you can try to grab them all with in-depth and specific annotations, delve into one specific stream, or just take in the spectacle and come back later. I took the third option. The themes presented were all worth diving into in-depth. A juicy 3-page passage on philosophy would be followed up by an even juicer 10-page passage on religion. There were reflections on the psychology of daily life. We saw family strife and meaning-making within a harsh and unforgiving environment. Loyalty and love, death, violence. Pride within society, pride within family, pride within the self. Pernicious pride. Belief. Faith. I am just throwing words at you at this point, but each of these prompts can take books to discuss (and such books do exist \u2013 Joseph Frank has a great set of lectures on Dostoyevsky). This is one where you can vividly picture coming back to often, and each time you do, a specific theme will be more salient than the previous read.<br><br>There are a lot of strengths to this novel. Two stand out to me above the rest: philosophical/psychological/theological arguments and characterization. Since I do not currently have the time or the expertise to discuss the former, I will write a few words about the latter. You have to have a great amount of respect for anyone (not just a novelist) who is capable of respectfully depicting people that he/she does not agree with. How easy it is to straw man! Dostoyevsky never once does that. That\u2019s what makes this book so thrilling, so genius. I can conceivably see readers falling along any spectrum with 5-6 different characters. And they would all have a point. I will betray some of my thoughts with my choice of adjectives to come.<br><br>You start with Fyodor Pavlovich, the father. Reprehensible buffoon. Takes everything, gives nothing. As my friends and I are so fond of saying, he is \u201can all around shit guy\u201d. Dimitri Fyodorovich, the eldest son. A former army man, an unfortunate drunk, a hopeless playboy. Talks big, falls at the feet of a woman who winks at him. Ivan Fyodorovich, the next son. Nihilist. Self-appointed smart one. To him, the arcane is anathema. He is, after all, part of the academics and intelligentsia of higher society Russia. Alexei Fyodorovich, the youngest son. Alyosha. Cuddly. Innocent. The \u201cfaith man\u201d. Radiates pure energy. Positivity. Honesty. Just a few, but the list can go on. When you put these characters in front of each other, make them interact, make them converse about faith, humanity\u2019s struggles, free will, destiny, etc., you have joy for the reader.<br><br>There is also the issue of translation. <a href=\"http://www.patrikbergman.com/2017/07/23/choosing-best-karamazov-translation/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">This</a> is a great article that discusses the different translations of <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>. There are a great number of them thrown at you if you walk into any bookstore to buy yourself a copy - Constance Garnett, David McDuff, Richard Pevear &amp; Larissa Volokhonsky, Ignat Avsey, Andrew R. MacAndrew. I\u2019m a sucker for the Penguin Classics and I really wanted to gravitate toward it (translated by McDuff). However, I have been on this wave with Pevear and Volokhonsky, so I decided... why not. I\u2019ll go a different one each time anyway. I have come to realize that scholars of Russian works are not <i>necessarily</i> all in with P&amp;V as I once thought. It seems to me that, on a scale from \u201cpoetic\u201d to \u201ctechnical\u201d, Garnett is poetic, McDuff is technical, and P&amp;V are a mix. So perhaps not a terrible place to start.<br><br>Many images came to mind as I read the book. I thought of Job, staying true to his faith. I thought of Nietzsche, his God, his vision of an atheistic world (\u201cIf there is no God,\u201d Ivan says, \u201ceverything is permitted\u201d). I thought of Socrates on his deathbed, surrounded by disciples and handing out a few final pieces of comforting wisdom. Most of all, one image remained with me, one that Dostoyevsky explicitly referenced - <i>Contemplator</i>, created by Ivan Kramskoi.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1634233817i/32048290._SY540_.jpg\" width=\"401\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Contemplator\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Everything I have talked about with the hopes, desires, and frustrations of the characters can be seen in those eyes. The tattered rags and the sad cloth/sac, the cane, the shoes. The frigid atmosphere is striking. I don\u2019t know why, but I keep coming back to this image. Maybe something to explore in the near future.<br><br>I have a Word document on my desktop with all the quotes that I took down from this book, but I will end with one that was particularly beautiful \u2013 until next time:<br><br><blockquote>\n  <i>We are of a broad, Karamazovian nature..., capable of containing all possible opposites and of contemplating both abysses at once, the abyss above us, an abyss of lofty ideals, and the abyss beneath us, an abyss of the lowest and foulest degradation.</i>\n</blockquote>",

    "text": "Why did Proust have to write a 4000 page novel, especially when there is not any discernable, coherent plot? Was it really necessary to have those extended society scenes, some of which lasted for 150 pages or so? Couldn\u2019t the whole thing have been tightened up a little and cut down to 1000 pages or so? <br /><br />I asked myself these questions at various points over the nine months it took me to journey through Proust\u2019s masterpiece. It was not until the final two volumes (and particularly the latter half of <i>Time Regained</i>) that it all started to make sense. The point Proust is trying to make can only be experienced (as opposed to realized intellectually) if you have plodded through the seemingly endless series of anecdotes, asides and philosophical musings. <br /><br />Proust is trying to tell us how the experiences of our past slip away from our memory and, as such, no longer have any obvious impact on us. In some cases, (i.e. sexual jealousy and grief), this is a good thing, lest the pain of these losses would forever burden us. But it also isolates us from those moments of pleasure, of experiencing pure beauty. We can try, through the vehicle of voluntary memory to retrieve \u201cthe good old days\u201d but we will get nothing more than a snapshot, and will not feel the experience of what it was really like in those moments. The only way to recapture lost time, Proust tells us, is through the involuntary memories that spontaneously arise from random sensory input (the taste of a madeleine soaked in tea, the experience of standing on uneven paving stones, the clang of a spoon against a dish) as it triggers the memories of the last time we experienced the same sensations along with the other physical and emotional sensations with which the catalytic sensation is associated. The experience of these sensations is actually of a purer form than we experienced when they happened to us the first time, because they are not impeded by all the other competing stimuli that were impinging on us at the time. At the time, for example, we may have been disappointed that this resort was not exactly what we had in mind, we may have been worried about the health of a loved one, we might be distracted by concerns of our professional careers. In this moment of recapturing the past, all that comes to us is the unadulterated form of the experience of pleasure. <br /><br />Of course, this is a pretty unreliable mechanism to tap into our past and, as Proust shows, it is fleeting as well. The only way to recapture the past in a lasting way is through the creation of a work of art: which is where the book comes in. How does a writer depict an experience which is eventually forgotten, and is then perfectly recaptured years later? Well, you have to help the reader have the experience of long stretches of time, of the entirety of a long life lived, complete with all the hundreds of people and experiences and moments of inspiration and self-doubt that come with it. When, in the last pages of <i>Time Regained</i>, Proust describes the incident of the \u201cgood night kiss\u201d (one of the earliest episodes of the book), I felt like this did occur 40 years ago, given how long ago I read it. And, as Proust, through his magnificent prose lovingly reconstructed the scene, it came back to me with the full force of his original description. He had succeeded in helping me recapture this literary event, and how beautiful the experience of it was! <br /><br />I certainly don\u2019t want to try to compete with the length of <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> itself with this review, so let me conclude quickly. Please, if you have any interest at all in serious literature, do not be thrown off by the length of this book. It is an unparalleled work of genius for which, as I hope I have argued successfully above, the length is an essential element. If you make the commitment, you will be rewarded. <br />",

    "text": "I took today off work because I need to put everything I own into boxes so I can move tomorrow, but obviously I can't begin doing that until I get some of these obsessive thoughts about Proust out of my system. I mean, can I? Nope. I can't! After all, this house is where I read Proust -- wait, I read <i>Swann's Way</i> before I moved here, which is pretty nuts to think about -- and so how can I move without reviewing the whole thing?<br /><br />I do feel pretty traumatized after finishing this book. Sort of shellshocked and confused with all these half-formed thoughts and intense inexplicable feelings bouncing around in me, and I don't know what to do with them or myself. Yesterday I wound up sitting in my friend's bar explaining Proust's aesthetic theories, but that kind of behavior'll get you kicked out of most places, and is not really becoming a young lady. And obviously that's where this website comes in.... what is it for, if not to unload just this kind of mental baggage?<br /><br />Reading Proust made me wish I were more of a scholar, so I could try to puzzle out some kind of literary context for what this book is. I feel like people think of Proust as being stuffy and old-fashioned and all crusty and ancient, but I think a lot of that has to do with the subject matter (a lost time with superficial resemblance to Jane Austen's milieu), so it's kind of shocking to remember what else was going on while he was writing this. I know this is dumb and there're much better comparisons, but I kept thinking while reading this that it was like thinking your whole life that New York punk in the seventies was all about the Ramones and imagining you really got what was going on then from just listening to that.... but then when you're in your mid-twenties someone suddenly plays you Television for the first time, and you're like <i>what?</i> Like you think you know what modernism is, it's like <i>Ulysses</i> or whatever, but then you find out it's got this completely insane cousin across the river who's just doing all these things that appear at first to have no relationship at all to everything you ignorantly thought you kind of understood at least a little bit before. Again, I'm not much of a scholar and what I'm saying probably doesn't make any sense. To be honest, I don't even know what \"modernism\" means, I just know it sounds literary.... I think what I'm trying to get at is that the relevance of Proust's concerns to his time aren't immediately obvious because his approach to them initially seems so weird and unfamiliar. But then you realize, while you're in it, that Proust is actually so much of his time it's incredible, and that what he's saying and doing was hugely innovative and exciting at the beginning of the last century, and actually, I'd say, remains as much so today. And I just kind of wish that I knew more about art and literature and whatnot so I could tie it all in better, since I sense there're all these fascinating connections and reference points, but I don't know what they are. I'd sort of like to sneak into some college class or something where they're reading Proust, and listen in, or at least steal their syllabus.... do they even read Proust in college? I feel like they don't. I mean, I never heard of him when I was in college, or after. I really hadn't. I honestly had no idea who Proust was until I started hanging out on this website.<br /><br />Anyway, for me the most relevant contemporary writer I thought of while reading this wasn't a novelist. A little background: I always really loathed the discipline of psychology and thought it was stupid. When I unwittingly enrolled in social work school, I was dismayed to discover that getting my MSW involved reading pages and pages of precisely this stuff I'd always looked down on.... My happy discovery was that Freud, at least, was actually a fabulous writer, and a lot of his ideas are totally fascinating and very beautiful. What I realized finally is that I just resented psychology for its pretension of pretending it's a science. But actually psychology's concerns and sometimes even their expression are hugely significant -- among the most significant -- and kind of wonderful. In fact, I decided, I love psychology, as long as it knows its place and realizes it's an art, not a science.... Freud said he wanted his case histories to read like short stories, so I think he understood this. Proust, of course, took this to an extreme, by exploring essentially the same territory, not in a short story, but in an extraordinarily long and in some ways kind of ridiculous novel. <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> is about the development of the mind, the experience of consciousness, the influence of past events and relationships on one's emotions and behavior.... all the same stuff Freud cared about, only it made more sense to me here, presented this way.<br /><br />I completely lost my shit reading the last couple pages of this book, and broke down on some fundamental level in a way I imagine was akin to what you can get from really top-shelf psychotherapy. Towards the end of the book, Proust explains everything he's been trying to do, and just did, in writing this novel. It's his theory of art and specifically of literature, and it's pretty hard to argue with since you've watched him just do it. One of the things that Proust says is that readers of his book \"would not be my readers but readers of themselves, my book serving merely as a sort of magnifying glass, such as the optician of Combray used to offer to a customer, so that through my book I would give them the means of reading in their own selves\" (p. 384). I guess that could sound unexciting, ripped out of context, but he really does do this, and it truly is astounding. I felt throughly convinced by Proust's theory of what art is for, and as far as I'm concerned he was totally successful in accomplishing his aims. Like psychotherapy, <i>ISoLT</i> attempts to dive into the murk of the unconscious past to retrieve experiences and cognitions that have become inaccessible. Proust dives in and swims down to the bottom, and he finds them, and he grabs them, and he brings them back up and then hands them to you.... Which is pretty nuts. I mean, it's intense. I feel fucked up from it.<br /><br />Hm. I thought I wanted to talk about this book, but maybe I just want to pack up my shit after all. I really do want to review this book, but maybe it's too soon? It's a really insane novel, and there's tons of stuff in it I'd really love to dork out about on here.... but yeah, maybe too soon. I might come back and say something more coherent later on, when it's all settled down a bit.<br /><br />I guess the only thing I need to add right at this moment is that I really felt like Proust gave me this particular combination of the things I need most. I really can't read anything too difficult or serious, and to anyone who's considering giving Proust a try -- I can't emphasize this enough -- forget what you heard: this book is anything but a ponderous drag. It's silly and hilarious and smart and bizarre, and there's tons of fashion and sex and depravity and satire and insane plot twists that don't make any sense. I personally have a very short attention span and I cannot and do not read anything that isn't vastly entertaining. <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> is VASTLY ENTERTAINING!! (Except for <i>The Captive,</i> which is only somewhat entertaining.) This is not to say that it's for everyone, and I can see how lots of people would totally hate this. HOWEVER: it's definitely worth a shot, because this book could change your life. I mean that. It could. I'm a completely different person now than I was when I started. So what if this means I'm now an obsessively jealous, elitist, antisemitic, agoraphobic pervert who speaks exclusively in run-on sentences? I think I'm better for it, and you might be too.",

The writer\u2019s work is merely a kind of optical instrument which he offers the reader to enable him to discern what, without this book, he would perhaps never have perceived in himself.</i>\n</blockquote><br />I struggled with Proust, on and off, for three years. I read these books sitting, standing, lying down, in cars and on trains, waiting in airports, on commutes to work, relaxing on vacation. Some of it I read in New York, some in Madrid, Lisbon, Vienna. By now this book functions as my own madeleine, with different passages triggering memories from widely scattered places and periods in my life.<br /><br />I am surprised I reached the end. Every time I put down a volume, I was sure I would never pick up another; each installment only promised more of the same and I had already had more than enough; but then the nagging sense of the incomplete overcame my aversion and, with mixed feeling, I would pick up the next one and repeat the experience.<br /><br />Throughout this long voyage, my response to Proust has been consistent\u2014I should say consistently inconsistent\u2014alternately admiration and frustration. There are times when I fall completely under Proust\u2019s spell, and times when I find his writing intolerable. Probably this mixture has much to do with what Harold Bloom called the \u201canxiety of influence,\u201d since almost as soon as I finished the first volume, I started working on a novel, a novel which very clearly bears the traces of Proust\u2019s influence. It may be that, with Proust, I have something of an Oedipal complex, and I need to lodge criticism at his work in order to clear the air for my own\u2014though I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that my reactions to this book have proven tempestuous and I have yet to spur myself to write a fair review.<br /><br />When approaching a novel of this size and complexity, it is difficult to know where to start. Can <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> even be called a novel? In a writing class my instructor told us that any story needs to have a protagonist, an objective, a series of obstacles, a strategy for overcoming these obstacles, a sequence of failures and successes, all of it culminating in a grand climax that leads directly to a resolution. If you look carefully, you can, indeed, make out the bare outline of this dramatic pattern in Proust\u2019s work. But, like the slender skeleton of a peacock buried under a mountain of feathers, this outline serves as a vague scaffold over which are draped colorful ornament; and it is the ornament that attracts our attention.<br /><br />In most novels, any given passage will serve some dramatic purpose: characterization, description, plot. However, there are times when the author will pull back from the story to make a more general comment, on society, humanity, or the world. These comments are, very often, pungent and aphoristic\u2014the most quotable section of the whole book, since they do not depend on their context. Some authors, like Dickens, very infrequently make these sorts of remarks; others, like George Elliot, are full of them: <i>\u201cWill not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot out the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the blot? I know of no speck so troublesome as self.\u201d</i><br /><br />Elliot\u2019s masterpiece, <i>Middlemarch</i>, is distinguished for being simultaneously didactic and dramatic, equal parts analysis and art. Proust goes even further in the direction of analysis, totally overwhelming every other aspect of the book with his ceaseless commentary. No event, however insignificant, happens without being dissected; the Narrator lets no observation go unobserved, even at the cost of being redundant. This endless exegesis, circling the same themes with relentless exactitude, is what swells this book to its famously vast proportions. Tolstoy, no laconic writer, used less than half the length to tell a story that spanned years and encompassed whole nations. The story Proust tells could have been told by, say, Jane Austen in 400 pages\u2014although this would leave out everything that makes it worth reading.<br /><br />Different as the two authors are, the social milieu Proust represents is oddly reminiscent of Jane Austen\u2019s world, being populated by snobby aristocrats who jostle for status and who never have to work, a world of elegant gatherings, witty conversation, and artistic dilettantism. Austen and Proust also share an affinity for satirizing their worlds, although they use different means for very different ends. In any case, both Austen\u2019s England and Proust\u2019s France are long gone, and it can be very difficult for the modern reader to sympathize with these characters, whose priorities, manners, and lifestyle are so distant from our own. Why should we care about soir\u00e9es and salons, dukes and duchesses, who do nothing but gossip, pursue petty love affairs, and pontificate ignorantly in their pinched world?<br /><br />Yet this narrow social milieu, though always in focus, only forms the backdrop for Proust\u2019s real purpose; and this purpose is suitably universal: to create a religion of art. A new religion was needed. Proust was writing at a turbulent time in European history: in the aftermath of the Death of God, as the fin de si\u00e8cle high society of his youth was shattered by World War I, as new notions of psychology overturned old verities of human behavior, as every convention in art, music, and literature was being broken. Even the physical world was becoming unrecognizable\u2014populated by quantum fields and bending space-time. It was the world of Freud\u2019s unconscious, Einstein\u2019s relativity, and Picasso\u2019s cubism, when new theories about everything were embraced. Granted, Proust may have been only peripherally aware of these historical currents, but he was no doubt responsive to them, as this novel amply proves.<br /><br />In this book, Proust sets out to show that our salvation lays in art. This means showing us that our salvation does not lay in anything else. Specifically, Proust must demonstrate that social status and romantic love, two universal human aspirations, are will-o\u2019-the-wisps. He does this subtly and slowly. First, as a young man, the Protagonist is awed by high society. The names of famous actresses, writers, composers, and most of all socialites\u2014the aristocratic Guermantes\u2014hold a mysterious allure that he finds irresistible. He slowly learns how to behave in salons and to hold his own in conversation, eventually meeting all the people he idolized from afar. But when he finally does make the acquaintance of these elite socialites, he finds that their wit is exaggerated, their knowledge superficial, their opinions conventional, their artistic taste deficient. In short, the allure of status was empty.<br /><br />And not only that, temporary. In the final volume, Proust demonstrates that status waxes and wanes with changes of fashion, often in unforeseen ways. By the end of the book, Rachel, who began as a prostitute, is a celebrated actress; while Berma, who began as a celebrated actress, ends as a broken down old women, still respected but no longer fashionable. The Protagonist\u2019s friend, Bloch, who is a flatfooted, stupid, and awkward man, ends the book as a celebrated author, despite a total lack of originality or wit. The Baron de Charlus, an intensely proud man, ends up doffing his hat to nearly anyone he runs into in the street, while the rest of society ostracizes him. Status, in other words, being based on nothing but mass whim, is liable to change whimsically.<br /><br />Proust\u2019s views of love are even more cynical. The Protagonist does have a genuine affection for his mother and grandmother; but these are almost the only genuine bonds in the entire long novel. When Proust looks at romantic love, he sees only delusion and jealousy: an inability to see another person accurately combined with a narcissistic urge to possess and a paranoia of losing them. The archetypical Proustian relationship is that between Swann and Odette, wherein Swann, a figure in high-society, has a casual dalliance with Odette, a courtesan, and despite not thinking much of Odette, Swann nearly loses his mind when he begins to suspect she is cheating on him. He marries Odette, not out of romantic passion, but in order to gain some measure of peace from his paranoid jealousy.<br /><br />Summarized in this way, Proust\u2019s views seem, if somewhat disenchanted, hardly radical. But the real thrust of Proust\u2019s thinking depends on a truly radical subjectivism. This book, as Harold Bloom points out, is wisdom literature, firmly rooted in the introspective tradition of Montaigne. But Proust is more than introspective. A true Cartesian, Proust is solipsistic. And much of his rejection of worldly sources of happiness, and his concomitant embrace of art, depends on this intensely first-person view of the world.<br /><br />In his emphasis on the subjective basis of reality, Proust\u2019s thought is often oddly reminiscent of Buddhism. Our personalities, far from being stable, are nothing but an endless flux that changes from moment to moment; each second we die and are born again. What\u2019s more, we perceive other people through the lens of our own desires, knowledge, opinions, and biases, and therefore never perceive accurately. There are as many versions of you as there are people to perceive you. Thus we never really know another person. Our relationships with friends and lovers are really relationships with mental constructions that have only a tenuous connection with the real person:<br /><blockquote>\n  <i>The bonds between ourselves and another person exist only in our minds. Memory as it grows fainter loosens them, and notwithstanding the illusion by which we want to be duped and with which, out of love, friendship, politeness, deference, duty, we dupe other people, we exist alone. Man is the creature who cannot escape from himself, who knows other people only in himself, and when he asserts the contrary, he is lying.</i>\n</blockquote><br />You might think that this is a shockingly cynical view, and it is; but Proust adheres to it consistently. Here he is on friendship:<br /><blockquote>\n  <i>\u2026 our friends being friends only in the light of an agreeable folly which travels with us through life and to which we readily accommodate ourselves, but which at the bottom of our hearts we know to be no more reasonable than the delusions of the man who talks to furniture because he believes that it is alive\u2026</i>\n</blockquote><br />And love, of course, comes off even worse than friendship:<br /><blockquote>\n  <i>Almost everyone was surprised at the marriage, and that in itself is surprising. No doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon we call love, or how it creates, so to speak, a supplementary person, distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name, a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourselves.</i>\n</blockquote><br />In the dissolving acid of Proust\u2019s solipsism, one can see why he considers both social status and romantic love as vain pursuits, since they are not, and can never be, based on anything but a delusion. <br /><br />Of course, status and love do bring people happiness, at least temporarily. But Proust is careful to show that all happiness and sadness caused by these things have nothing to do with their reality, but only with our subjective understanding of that reality. Depending on how we interpret a word or analyze an intention; depending on whether we hold someone in esteem or in contempt\u2014depending, in short, on how we subjectively understand what we experience\u2014we will be happy or sad. The source of all suffering and bliss is in the mind, not the world, but we are normally blind to this fact and thus go on mistakenly trying to alter the world: <i>\u201cI had realized before now that it is only a clumsy and erroneous perception which places everything in the object, when really everything is in the mind\u2026\u201d</i><br /><br />As you can see, we are moving in a strikingly mystical direction, where love and success are just egotistic delusions, hypostatized mental artifacts that we mistake for solid reality. So what should we do? Proust\u2019s answer to this predicament is also mystical in flavor. Normally we are trapped by our perspective, thinking that we are viewing reality when we are actually just experiencing our own warped mental apparatus. To break us out of this trap we must first experience unhappiness: <i>\u201cAs for happiness, that is really useful only in one way only, by making unhappiness possible.\u201d</i> And unhappiness results when something we mistook to be solid\u2014reputation, love, even life itself\u2014is shown to be fleeting and unreal, that our everyday reality is based on nothing but lies, mistakes, and misunderstandings. You might say this is Proust\u2019s version of Christian consolation. For in the despair that opens up during these crises, we can give up our fantasies and partake in Proustian mysticism.<br /><br />This mysticism consists in reconnecting with our basic sensations. To do this, Proust does not, like the Buddhists, turn to meditation on the present moment. Instead, he relies on art and memory. Normal language is totally inadequate to this task. Our words, being universally used, only convey that aspect of experience that is common to everyone; all the individual savor of a perception, its most essential quality, is lost. But great artists\u2014like the fictitious Vinteuil, Bergotte, or Elstir\u2014can use their medium to overcome the usual limits of discourse, transmitting the full power of their perspectives. Even so, this artistic communication can only act as a spur for our own introspective quest. Shorn of illusory happiness, inspired by example, we can probe our own memory and experience the bliss of pure experience.<br /><br />Memory is essential in this, for Proust thinks that it is only by juxtaposing one experience with another that we can see the perception in its pure form, without any reference to our conventional reality. This is why moments of involuntary memory, like the madeleine episode, are so important for Proust: it is in these moments, when a present experience triggers a long-buried memory, that we can re-visit the experiences of our past, free from delusion, as a pure impartial spectator. The final Proustian wisdom is essentially contemplative, passive, aesthetic, able to see the ironies of human life and to appreciate the recurring patterns of human existence.<br /><br />Proust\u2019s goal, then, is to do for the reader what Bergotte, Elstir, and Vinteuil did for his Narrator: to create art that acts as a window to the self. And his style is exactly suited to this purpose. In my review of a book on meditation, I noted what I called the \u201cnovelistic imagination,\u201d which is our tendency to see the world as a setting and ourselves as the Protagonist, beset by trials and tribulations. Meditation aims to break out of this rather unrealistic mindset by focusing on the present moment. Proust\u2019s aim is similar but his method is different. He takes the narrative tendency of the novelistic imagination, and stretches and stretches, pulling each sentence apart, twisting it around itself, extending the form and padding the structure until the narration is hardly narration at all, until you are simply swimming in a sea of sounds.<br /><br />By doing so, Proust allows you to feel the passage of time, to make time palpable and real, and to feel our memory processing and being activated over and over again in response to passing sensations. This way, Proust hopes to bring us in contact with reality: <i>\u201cAn hour is not merely an hour, it is a vase full of scents and sounds and projects and climates, and what we call reality is a certain connection between these immediate sensations and the memories which envelop us simultaneously with them\u2026\u201d</i><br /><br />This is my attempt to elucidate Proust\u2019s aesthetic religion. Of course, like any religion of art, it is objectionable for manifold reasons: it lacks any moral compass, it is elitist, it is purely passive. Not only that, but Proust connects with his religion a solipsism that is questionable on philosophic grounds, not to mention cynical in the extreme. It is a cold, antisocial, unsympathetic doctrine, with appeal only to disenchanted aesthetes. But of course, this is ultimately a work of art and not of philosophy; and so <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> must be judged on literary grounds. <br /><br />When it comes to the criteria by which we judge a usual novelist\u2014characterization, dialogue, plot\u2014I think Proust is somewhat weak. There is, of course, little plot to speak of. And although Harold Bloom thought that Proust was a rival of Shakespeare when it came to characterization\u2014a judgment that baffles me\u2014I felt very little for any of the people in this novel. They all speak in Proust\u2019s longwinded voice, and so never came alive for me. It always seems as if I am overhearing Proust describe someone rather than meeting them myself.<br /><br />But of course one cannot appraise Proust using these standards. This novel is, above all, audacious. It is a modernist tour de force, which turns nearly every novelistic convention on its head. More than that, it is a novel of ideas, which puts forward a radical view of the human predicament and its own answers to the perennial questions of life. It is wisdom literature rooted deeply in tradition, while being absolutely original and uncompromising in its newness. It is both intensely beautiful and intensely ugly\u2014hideously sublime. For anyone who can pull themselves through all its pages, it will leave them deeply marked. I know I have been.",

    "text": "\u201cWe do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. The lives that you admire, the attitudes that seem noble to you, have not been shaped by a paterfamilias or a schoolmaster, they have sprung from very different beginnings, having been influenced by evil or commonplace that prevailed round them. They represent a struggle and a victory.\u201d <br /><br />Proust is a great teacher. This may sound embarrassingly platitudinous, and yet I find that it is a fact altogether too easily overlooked in our incessant praise (or bemoaning) of his technical achievements as a stylistic innovator. Setting aside for a while the whole issue of innovative narrative technique (which is nonetheless essential to the realization of his thought through literary art), we can appreciate that he has something important to teach us about what it means to be wise, or, in short, a more fully realized human being. <br /><br />He does so by bodying forth through narrative a model (I'd even say, a paradigm) of the process of self-knowledge. In so doing, he becomes an indispensable companion to our own most personal and intimate developmental struggle to compass the manifold, disjointed flux of experience into a coherent, meaningful whole that we can point to as \u201cour self.\u201d As psychologists now recognize, a series of narrative acts (or \u201cacts of meaning,\u201d as Jerome Bruner put it) weave together, one by one, the fabric of our identity. What we are fundamentally is a narrative identity, a carefully demarcated world of meaning to which we cling in the face of the flux (notice Proust's recurring focus of description: thresholds and borders, doorways and windows, walls and fences). The slow construction of this most fundamental narrative unity that constitutes the real ground of our most mundane awareness is Proust's chosen theme. <br /><br />This fundamental understanding of the self-making self is, paradoxically, the culmination of the pursuit of self-knowledge. And in this, Proust puts his finger on the very pulse of what identity means and can mean in our historical epoch. As Charles Taylor points out in Sources of the Self, the fundamental understanding of an ineradicable and refractory (to the theoretical understanding and its search for pure transparency) poietic element that lies at the heart of all our acts of knowing is foundational for modern thought in general. In short, we make the self we strive to know, necessarily. Deliberations about meanings to entertain and construct form the very ground we stand on in our attempts to reflect and to know Self. <br /><br />In this, Proust's narrative art implicitly critiques the foundational move of Western philosophy and intellectual history alike: namely, Plato's separation between narrative and knowledge, theoria and poiesis, art and philosophy. Proust seems to say that theoria is poietic, and poiesis is theoretical, and reminds us the more primal etymological sense of narrative (gno \u2013 to know). In this, he elevates the modern novel to the status of a privileged epistemic instrument and redefines the aim of wisdom. The artist stakes out for himself his own wisdom path distinct from that of the philosopher. The knowing to be sought is the kind of knowing we live by. His narrative re-enacts those acts of knowing by which we structure a life-story and come to affirm a self, and then later, transcend it.<br /><br />The mainstream of modern thought has, of course, led in the opposite direction. Reductionist mechanism aspires to corner the mind into some ultimate system, a self-made cage of thought - a Theory of \u201cEverything\u201d - from which it may never again emerge to see the light of day. Any access to immediate experience must be mediated by said totalizing System; any experience that does not fit therein is to be explained away. While we managed to keep at bay political totalitarianism as a civilization, intellectual totalitarianism still rules the day as an ever-appetizing lodestar. If we could but persuade ourselves to stay in the box we made, we might buy ourselves some semblance of certainty, provided we forget we ourselves have fabricated it. William Barrett, in \u201cThe Illusion of Technique,\u201d outlines this totalizing aspect of modern thought well when he shows how time and again, the great thinkers of modernity are subject to the irresistible temptation to \u201creify the objects of their symbolism,\u201d thereby becoming \u201cvictims of their own language.\u201d<br /><br />Proust's approach to the whole question of how we may become wise differs from this mainstream in two ways: first, he avoids becoming a \u201cvictim of (his) symbolism\u201d by adopting a \u201cmeta\u201d stance vis-a-vis his own cognitive framings, and second, he validates the adequacy to experience of his methodology by continually touching base with where we actually stand in our most intimate dealings with the world through a close description of detail. <br /><br />I already touched on the first, but essentially, the critical decision here lies in his not assuming transparency and instead foregrounding and scrutinizing the constructive process of knowing a life as it unfolds. There is wisdom in this, for by pretending that our mental filters are transparent to reality, we risk mistaking the specks of dirt on our windowpane for features in the landscape. The fundamental working metaphor Proust operates with here is the magic lantern of the mind. This is introduced early on in the context of one of those childhood revelations that seems to suddenly make clear for us the sense of this strange, shadowy life. The young narrator lying in his bed awaiting sleep while struggling with separation anxiety from his mother, watched the projected fairytale images of the magic lantern gliding across his walls, furniture, doorknob. The reference to Plato's Cave is unmistakable, and yet the wisdom to be found here lies not in \"peering through\" to the substantial origin of these shadowy fairytale forms that float over the surface of our awareness. The umbilical chord to such cosmic orders is severed, for Proust as for so many moderns. We are left floating in a sea of images, that strange, in-between realm where mind approaches nature but never quite rests in a secure grasp of it. <br /><br />The best lucidity we can hope for comes from an acceptance of the free-floating quality of the magic lantern of our minds: it touches reality only when, as the projected fairytale images, the form is distorted as it glides over an obtruding object, such as the doorknob. The entire rest of the narrative is like a grand cartography of the magic lantern of the mind, and of the unshakable, unsettling, yet poignant sense of irreality that it brings to the heart of even our most lucid daylight experience. In this, Proust has a lot in common with the stripping down of layer upon layer of formal illusion that characterizes Zen meditation. The work is indeed much like a guided meditation manual. The hard-earned lucidity to be found at the culmination of the gathering back together act at the end of the narrative, in Time Regained, is one not of \u201cseeing through\u201d to some architectonic world-structure (which must always in the end be a cognitive artifact endlessly referencing us even as we struggle to wipe ourselves out of our picture); it is instead a lucidity that comes from a comprehensive grasp of the ineradicable stain our filtration systems leave on even the most intimate, seemingly immediate moments. We never stand in the light of day. It is a scary realization, but an unshakable one, and one that peers at the very heart of the human condition. We always stand in the shadow of our own form, and of our limited capacity for realization. Our relation to reality must be understood (and more fully realized) by incrementally beating against our walls, at last coming to make peace with them, and in so doing, finding our only possible transcendence. <br /><br />And second, we come to the crucial revelation detailed description allows and that theoretical systems by their nature must overlook. Detailed description, while making lazy readers cringe, is the writer's best friend, as well as his/her greatest advantage over the philosophical systematizer. It is how the modern novel becomes a philosophically significant epistemic instrument. In my review of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, I noted that Kant and Proust can be understood as complementary opposites of the phenomenological spectrum, and that a fully realized self-understanding must encompass both the stances that they represent. Kant offers the phenomenology of logical principles, Proust the sketch of phenomenological form by which we gain a hold of lived experience. I'd add here that there's simply no philosophical substitute for Proust and for the kind of world-disclosure his narrative technique enables: he is a better cartographer of Heidegger's Clearing and Husserl's Lifeworld than they ever could be (although I deeply admire both). And this is because his (literary) methodology allows him to scrutinize and lay bare the workings of that fundamental act of reflective thought: description. It goes right to the heart of our moment-to-moment encounter with reality in re-enacting the constructive framing we impose through our descriptions. <br /><br />One has to admire the lucidity and tenacity with which Proust takes up his analytical scalpel to the most indefinite, amorphous phenomena. He is, in my estimation, a cartographer of indefinite who charts the limits of representation, and thus, of our capacity for lucidity and meaning. To define and articulate the undefinable details of lived experience \u2013 while foregrounding the constructive nature of all such articulation, definition, and cognitive framing - is both his (insane) narrative task and greatest epistemic achievement. Relish a densely descriptive paragraph of his, say, of a summer field, or of the subtly shifting feel of the atmosphere and mood change of a room as different personages enter and exit. Countless pages meticulously render articulate what we usually allow to fester untapped in the margins of liminal awareness, through synaesthetic descriptions that try to recapture the comprehensive feel of the mingling of shades at twilight, of the shifting of air currents, of the interpenetration of music and scent, and then of the pain of lack running through it all, of never attaining some culminating state of sufficiency. For my own part, far from having to strain to appreciate the descriptive passages, I find they provide meditative exercise that gives me the tools to better bring my day-to-day experiences to articulate clarity, instead of lazily allowing them to glide past. In so doing, they intensify my capacity for awareness and presence in the world. Both cognitive form and narrative technique here are opened up to their widest capaciousness and plasticity in order to incorporate not only dramatic action, but its peripheral reverberation, not only central figure but its background of embeddedness, not only words but their echoes, too. <br /><br />I feel more alive after reading Proust, more present to my experiences, and more ashamed at how much of my life I let slip by me each and every day. The perspective the narrator achieves over his life here makes our usual biographical sense seem botched and anemic. In comparison, it seems like we have scarcely deigned to show up for our life story much at all. Instead of integrating and transcending in a moment of lucidity that surpasses our highest attained perspectival unity, as the narrator does at the culmination of the narrative when the various strands somehow coalesce, we just let it all slip by, rush on to the next thing, and through this habit enacted out of laziness, skim through our lives without delving deeper into the mystery they disclose. Experience washes over us and past us, leaving us untransformed and not building up to a unity, which is indeed wholly ours. <br /><br />His analysis of the pervasiveness of Habit as our substitute for awareness here is sobering. \u201cMost of our faculties lie dormant because they can rely upon Habit, which knows what there is to be done and has no need of their services.\u201d He shows how through it, we fall back on prematurely fossilized interpretive structures - \u201cour personality\u201d - and fail to rise up to the task of continuing to develop resources for gathering meanings as they continue to unfold and emerge. The entire work seems to urge us to recall that psychological maturation, unlike physical, doesn't occur automatically or is finished once and for all at a specific moment in time after puberty. It ends with death, or with its psychological correlative \u2013 the death we experience when we opt out of the necessarily ongoing struggle to continue articulating an increasingly integrative perspective on our lives. Premature unity is psychological death; through it, our lives become a foreclosed matter. As Beckett notes in his study of Proust, \u201cThe creation of the world did not take place once and for all time, but takes place every day.\u201d The same goes for our own little life-world. There is no resting in the process of endless formal development until death because experience never ceases to unfold new capacities for revelation. Our understanding can never rest content with yesterday's story when facing today's experiences. <br /><br />Proust shows us what the stakes for self-knowledge are, and this is as inspiring for us ordinary (barely aware) mortals as it is supremely humbling. And it is enabling, as any creative work should be. It shows the way to greater realization.<br />",

I clutched my head.\"<br /><br />I heartily agree. Nor do I like dinner parties that take longer to read about than they took to occur. The main problem with Proust (and his admirers) is that they are convinced that the French aristocracy, with all their trivial concerns and all their trivial conversations, were actually interesting. In reality, they were very dull and conventional people. One of Proust's friends actually said that to him, but Proust was too status-struck to listen.<br /><br />The only character in the books I liked was Charles Morel, because he screwed everyone over and treated them like dirt.

I don't know if I'm ready to try to explain or even understand the whole of Proust yet. Hell, I'm not sure I'm ready to look at myself that closely yet.<br><br>Reading Proust was a bit like reading 'Finnegans Wake'. Certainly not the details or style mind you. Proust wasn't deliberately sending his prose into language fractals, neologisms and ghillie suits of his own idioglossia.

Proust isn't trying to hide, he is seeking to uncover. <br><br>Both works, however, are best approached as literature that shouldn't be sipped. These are pieces that you need to let wash over you. You will miss parts for sure, but unless you are a Joyce or Proust scholar you won't uncover 1/10 of what they are really sending your direction anyway. Let the prose roll. Let the message(s) seep into your conciousness. Beware of the designs of the left-brained temptor to stop every sentenece and try to comprehend completely what was written. Finnegans wake is too obscure and ISoLT is too damn long to do this.

It drained me but I was in awe of Proust. I took a long break before returning to Vol. 2 in 2021. By the time I was ready for Vol. 3, now in March 2022, I had been reading the novel for 2 years. Since March I have read a volume every month (technically two volumes in May as they are combined into one) to finish now, in June. My journey with Proust rushed to a sudden end after a long and slow beginning. <br><br>I was keen to see if it changed my life or something of the sort. I don't think it has, but maybe it's too early to tell. Am I glad I did it though? Or rather, was it worth it? I think it's hard to know how to answer that; I think there's so much pressure put onto making the most of your time, or not wasting time, these days. There's constant movement and stimulation from almost every direction. It's very rare to see someone just standing and staring into space. I think reading Proust is a little like putting the world into slow-motion, and even after putting the book down, the world <i>is</i> a little slower. That's the thing with reading, it helps us to understand, but it also helps us to think and to live. So in some way I could say Proust has helped me to live and understand better. It was really a test of endurance than difficulty; Proust is not 'hard' to read, he's just long, oh so long. The novel finishes at over 4000 pages long. For me the best volumes are the first and the third. The last three were never edited by Proust and they are full of inconsistencies, but having said that, the prose itself hardly suffers without the edits he probably imagined. <br><br>It's surreal to say I'm done, though I'm not and never will be. I guess thanks for the long ride, Proust. I wish I tallied up how long I physically spent reading these books, timed myself per reading session, to add it all up. The guy I work with has something like 4000 hours on this one particular computer game, which I worked out for him as being equivalent to spending five months straight without stopping. Five months of his life on a computer game. But we spend our time where we enjoy it, and he enjoys it. To him, no doubt, spending God knows how many hours reading this book about a boy dipping a biscuit into his tea and remembering the whole of his human experience and ruminating on life, art, time, memory, love, sexuality, being, etc., probably seems like an utter waste of time and effort.

I had read various other books by/on Proust over the past two decades, and had read enough sections of <i>Temps perdu</i> to know that it was extremely good, but somehow everything else in my reading list kept taking precedence. <br /><br />In any event, two somewhat challenging months later, and the novel was roughly as good as I had expected from the sampling I\u2019d read over the years; i.e., very, very good. With that said, I\u2019m never reading Proust again (beyond maybe revisiting the best couple hundred pages); it\u2019s great but not in the stratosphere of books like <i>Ulysses</i> or <i>Memoires d'Hadrien</i> that I'll happily reread every few years until I die. <br /><br />Some books just take more work; Proust definitely reminds me of Broch or Gaddis, where the work-to-enjoyment ratio is high -- still definitely 'worth it', yet probably not for rereading. (I should note here that I have no sense of obligation to finish novels that I don't enjoy, and would have happily stopped reading Proust at any point if I thought he wasn't worth the effort.) The closest analogy I can think of is reading especially difficult or dense philosophy, where it\u2019s challenging, but in a good way; I don\u2019t think anyone reads Husserl or Scotus for \u201cenjoyment,\u201d precisely, yet they're still a joy to read at some level. <br /><br />One thing I\u2019ll say though; if you read Book 1 and don't <i>love</i> it, if you aren't blown away by the Overture / Combray sections, and aren\u2019t impressed with the psychological themes of Swann in Love, if you don\u2019t love the prose, then I would consider stopping there -- the remaining six books are (generally speaking) more of the same.<br /><br /><br />* * * * *<br /><br /><br />I'm certainly critical of some aspects of <i>Temps perdu</i>, but I just want to emphasize here at the outset that when Proust is good, he\u2019s just off-the-charts ridiculously amazing. Along with thousands of great lines, immortally impressive pages include (Random House pagination):<br /><br />Book 1: I:46-47, I:50-51, I:64-66, I:68, I:142, I:145, I:164-166, I:428, I:462<br /><br />Book 2: I:684, I:704-705, I:871-872, I:899-900, I:959, I:995<br /><br />Book 3: II:7-10, II:61, II:95, II:157, II:323-357 (grandmother\u2019s death), II:399, II:436-437, II:617-620<br /><br />Book 4: II:657, II:778-809 (intermittencies of the heart), II:927-928, II:1062, II:1132, II:1148<br /><br />Book 5: III:74, III:100-101, III:186, III:251-252, III:259-262, III:380-382, III:413<br /><br />Book 6: III:692<br /><br />Book 7: III:709, III:757-758, III:778, III:785-786, III:828, III:876, III:898-909 (the revelation of involuntary memory), III:910-916, III:931, III:939, III:1087-89, III:1107<br /><br /><br /><br />I would put these 155 pages up against the best 155 pages of any novelist of any era; I think probably Joyce comes out ahead but I can\u2019t think of too many others who are really in contention. And this doesn\u2019t even get into his other strengths; e.g., Proust\u2019s descriptions of nature are relatively rare (he prefers inner landscapes) but even those are incredibly good:<br /><br />II(3):360: \"The fog had lifted. The grey light, falling like a fine rain, wove without ceasing a transparent web through which the Sunday strollers appeared in a silvery sheen.\"<br /><br />II(3):400: \"A few drops of rain fall soundlessly on the ancient water which, in its divine infancy, remains always the color of the weather and continually forgets the reflections of clouds and flowers.\"<br /><br />II(4):894: \". . . taking her head in my hands, and showing her the wide shadows, flooded and silent, which extended in the gathering dusk to a horizon closed by the parallel chains of distant blue hills.\"<br /><br /><br /><br />Proust is also an aphorism factory and it\u2019s hard to even narrow down the best ones . . . here's a few selected at random:<br /><br />I(2):594: \u201cAll original painting and music must always appear complicated and exhausting.\u201d<br /><br />I(2):955: \"An artificial novelty is never so effective as a repetition that manages to suggest a fresh truth.\"<br /><br />II(3):44: \"His playing has become so transparent, so imbued with what he is interpreting, that one no longer sees the performer himself -- he is simply a window opening upon a great work of art.\"<br /><br />II(3):236: \"Society is like sexual behavior, in that no one knows what perversions it may develop once aesthetic considerations are allowed to dictate its choices.\"<br /><br />II(3):358: \"A change in the weather is sufficient to create the world and ourselves anew.\"<br /><br />II(3):430: \"The highest praise of God consists in the denial of him by the atheist who finds creation so perfect it can dispense with a creator.\"<br /><br />III(5):382: \"The great men of letters have never created more than a single work, or rather have never done more than refract through various media an identical beauty which they bring into the world.\"<br /><br />III(7):916: \"An artwork in which there are theories is like an object which still has its price-tag on it.\"<br /><br />III(7):927 \". . . that flight to get away from our own life which goes by the name of erudition.\"<br /><br /><i>Letters</i> 393: \u201cArt is the perpetual sacrificing of inclination to truth.\u201d<br /><br /><br /><br />And there are so many other things that he gets right . . . the metaphors are unique and almost comically creative; virtually all of the essays on philosophy/art criticism/psychology are worth reading: the analysis of Elstir's painting at the end of Book 2, the opening essay on homosexuality in Book 4, the aesthetics essays in Book 5 and Book 7, and certainly the revelation in Book 7 of involuntary memory, which is up there with Joyce's Dollymount Strand vision in <i>Portrait</i>. Also, the characters -- where do you even begin with how good these characters are. They're similar to the archetypal yet individual characters of Tolstoy; St. Loup, Charlus, Francoise, Mme. Verdurin, Swann, Odette, and Elstir are just as memorable to me as Kitty, Anna, Vronsky, and the rest.<br /><br />Critics have of course praised the <i>tour de force</i> scenes such as the death of the narrator's grandmother, etc., but there are so many other minor scenes that don't get enough credit -- i.e., Swann tactfully bringing up his impending death at the Guermantes salon in the final four pages of Book 3 is so brilliant and darkly comic that I wonder why more critics haven't talked about it; Proust's virtuosity here is almost intimidating. Another thing that I don't think Proust gets enough credit for is the subtlety of the narrator's aging, it's a very slow and carefully calibrated adjustment where you suddenly realize, every few hundred pages, that the narrator is no longer a teeanger, is no longer a young man, etc., despite a strong continuity in the prose style -- it's similar to the real-life experience of looking in the mirror and suddenly realizing that you've aged a few years.<br /><br />With all that said, I cannot avoid talking about:<br /><br /><b>THE PROBLEM WITH ALBERTINE</b><br /><br />So when I first completed Proust, before I dove into the manuscript tradition to figure out what was going on, my first instinct was that the narrative became seriously bogged down with Albertine around the middle of Book 4, and that despite occasional good scenes in Books 4-6, the entire Albertine cycle was significantly weaker than the other material in <i>Temps perdu</i>. I have some other minor issues with Proust, to be sure -- e.g., I think it\u2019s fair to say that the salon/party scenes are, in general, simply not very good. If they were kept at a more reasonable length, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any issue; but Gide should have talked Proust down from the length of these scenes. I\u2019m not saying that the party scenes are somehow \u2018unnecessary\u2019 or \u2018boring\u2019; they're well-written in terms of line-by-line prose, I understand why they\u2019re in the novel, they add depth to the characters, etc. I\u2019m saying they\u2019re simply too <i>long</i>; Proust did not edit them correctly -- e.g., II(3):450-601 is repetitive in an unhelpful and uninteresting way, nothing is gained after the first 70 pages or so.<br /><br />The problem with Albertine, on the other hand, is a bit more serious. The sudden shift out of the Albertine narrative at III(6):670, with about forty pages left in Book 6, felt suspicious to me, and actually was the impetus for me to dig into Tadi\u00e9\u2019s scholarship and figure out if my intuition was correct, i.e., that the whole \u2018Albertine novels\u2019 sequence was a later addition grafted onto a pre-existing narrative. (Oddly enough, I went through an identical process after reading Gaddis's <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395058.The_Recognitions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Recognitions</a>, where I had a suspicion that the inferior 400-page \"Greenwich Village novel\" was jammed into the superior 500-page \"Gwyon/Wyatt Novel,\" and it turned out that I was right.)<br /><br />Before working through Tadi\u00e9, I had a vague sense that you could maybe improve <i>Temps perdu</i> by cutting the slowest few dozen pages of Swann in Love, tighten the Gilberte / Albertine material in Book 2, cut some of the party scenes in Book 3, most of the Albertine saga in Books 4-6, etc. Also the reveries are great, but there are, by any standard, too many of them; you wouldn\u2019t lose the \u2018atmosphere\u2019 of Proust if you had a tightened version that was a thousand (or, frankly, even two thousand) pages shorter. <br /><br />I certainly wouldn't say that these less-impressive sections are \u2018bad\u2019, exactly; rather, it\u2019s like <i>Paradise Lost</i>, of which Harold Bloom said: \u201cIt is a work that no one wishes were longer.\u201d No one is saying that Milton isn\u2019t a genius, but just that if he had published a version of <i>Paradise Lost</i> that was 30% shorter, maybe it would be better. (And if, say, someone were to stumble across a <i>longer</i> version of <i>Paradise Lost</i> in manuscript form in the Bodleian Libraries in 2039, it wouldn't be better just because it had more text by Milton.) <br /><br />Anyway, it turns out that the \"condensed Proust\" that I vaguely had in mind -- cutting a couple of the party scenes, almost everything with Albertine, and retaining all of the best passages (Overture-Combray, St. Loup, Elstir at Balbec, grandmother's death + intermittencies, the opera opening and early scenes in Book 3, the Charlus concert scene + drama at the Verdurins, most of Book 7), is <i>PRECISELY Proust's first completed version of the novel</i>.<br /><br />It is generally known, and even mentioned in the introduction to Montcrieff, that Proust had completed a three-volume version of <i>Temps perdu</i> in 1911-1912, which was in the later proofing/editing stages by early 1914. WW1 broke out, and publishing was no longer possible -- lead (used in printing presses) and paper were needed for the war effort -- which gave Proust a few years to expand his story by another 700,000 words, with the bulk of the writing happening in late 1914-1917. <br /><br />Tadi\u00e9 goes into the full manuscript history on pp. 562-655 of his <i>Proust: A Life</i> and it\u2019s just surreal. Everything that drags or is somehow unideal in the 1.3-million-word version -- or at least the vast, vast majority of it -- was added in 1914-1917 (with slight expansions in 1918-1921). Proust's original 1912 three-volume version had Overture/Combray, Swann in Love, Gilberte, Bergotte, Elstir, all of Balbec (except for the Albertine scenes, crucially), Charlus's concert and drama at the Verdurins, the grandmother\u2019s death + intermittencies, the St. Loup material, the airplane/car passages, the full conclusion and involuntary memory revelation in Book 7 (without the interminable party scene at the end), and so on . . . the \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of the seven-volume version were already there, completed, in a three-volume version, in 1912. (Incidentally, Proust instructed his housekeeper to burn the 32 notebooks containing the original, superior version of <i>Temps perdu</i>, which is . . . great.)<br /><br />Tadi\u00e9 is normally quite restrained and respectful of Proust, but he appears to be equally dismayed by this 1914-1917 development, writing: \"Suddenly the book was thrown into confusion by the invention of the character of Albertine.\" Proust himself referred to ALL of Albertine -- including where she was retroactively added to Book 2 and Book 3 -- as \u201cthe episode,\u201d or as Tadi\u00e9 says, \u201cthat is to say, the whole story of Albertine,\u201d which Proust \u201cadded to sections and chapters that had already been written and structured.\"<br /><br />A key bit of biographical data is important here \u2013 Proust had a (self-admitted, and by any measure) tempestuous, unhealthy, and obsessive sexual relationship with his secretary, Alfred Agostinelli, from late 1913 until the latter's death in May 1914. Most Albertine sections were originally drafted in 1915; it should be kept in mind that many of Proust's friends were dying in WW1 at this point, and he was also taking a heroic amount of drugs (amyl nitrate, barbituates, opiates, datura, pure adrenaline) . . . in short, our author was not having a good time, mentally. His experience with Agostinelli is very clearly the impetus for the Albertine episode, which has such totally reasonable passages as, e.g.: \"A person need have no sincerity, nor even of skill in lying, in order to be loved. Here I mean by 'love' reciprocal torture\" (III:105).<br /><br />If the Albertine cycle had been published as a second, completely separate novel -- which it almost certainly should have been -- then this second novel would undoubtedly be seen as the inferior work. And again, it's worth noting that even the best scenes and mini-essays in Book 4 and Book 5 were written prior to 1913; e.g., the automobile scene with Albertine was originally written in 1907 with a different character. <br /><br />I'm not saying that Proust completely failed to incorporate the Albertine novel into <i>Temps perdu</i>; he did a reasonably good job of fitting Albertine into the preexisting novel. But this second stage has the least interesting material, by far. I think you can argue for an interlude from Book 4 to Book 7 where Morel-Charlus form a thematic counterpart to Marcel-Albertine, the homosexuality material, etc.; there\u2019s a very good 300-page novel in there somewhere. But adding 1,400 pages on Albertine simply overdoes it; the novel becomes top-heavy, unbalanced by too many love interests. The early delicately constructed balance of Gilberte and Oriane as the narrator's two loves (both of whom are strongly connected to Swann, whose affair with Odette forms the model for the narrator) is now confused by adding a third love interest; it just doesn't quite work. In Proust's defense, he was only 136 pages into editing Book 5 when he died, and odds are high that he would have ended up cutting a fair amount of the weakest material in Books 5-6 . . . but I have to go with the version we have. <br /><br />This is not to say that nothing of value was added in 1914-1917; the \"Paris at war\" scenes in Book 7 are indisputably impressive, the addition of the destruction of the Combray church (III:822) is brilliant, and some (though not all) of the essays in Book 7 were added in 1915-16. But the Proust of 1907-1912 is a very different writer, and clearly a better writer in my opinion, than the Proust of 1914-1921.<br /><br />In short, if Gavrilo Princip had stopped at any other cafe in Sarajevo on the afternoon of June 28, 1914, Gallimard would have published a 600,000 word, three-volume version of <i>Temps perdu</i> in 1915 that would likely have been held in even higher esteem than the 1.3m-word version that we have in our timeline. <br /><br />And as I later learned, many Proust scholars enthusiastically support the idea of a shortened/condensed Proust. Shattuck writes: \u201cWe have Frazer and Gibbon in one-volume editions . . . when copyright expires, will we be offered a pocket Proust?\u201d and then he offers a version that is similar to mine, though he proposes cutting slightly more material out of Books 3-4, along with some other adjustments. I can basically get on board with his version, though, again, I wouldn\u2019t cut quite as much; I also think you can maybe make a good version of the Albertine cycle, but it would need to be considerably shorter.<br /><br /><b>(end of part 1)</b><br /> <br /><b>[I sincerely apologize but there is somehow actually <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2008346841\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a second, equally long part of this review</a>]</b>",

(Theme #9\u2019s reveal is dependent of when them #10 is achieved). <br /><br />There's nothing from book 2 (nearly a thousand pages) to book 6 that adds thematic depth to anything beside theme 5 (the loss of his past long life), and theme 10 (reliving his memories).<br /><br />Basically the length of the book Is justified by trying to express the significance of those two themes.<br /><br />-<br /><br />1st reason why the book is this long - Theme 10: Writing the book to relive all those memories<br /><br />The story is so lengthy partly because Proust is reliving in full details his past life as a consolatory experience for his past mistakes. (and unexpected awareness of self-growth -which is already fully expressed in Swann\u2019s way through themes #6, #7, and #8).<br /><br />I understand that everyone is different, I really do.<br /><br />But themes need to be assessed by how meaningful they are.<br /><br />Otherwise everyone can just write about a theme like \u2018peeing is so liberating\u2019 and we can\u2019t critique them on that.<br /><br />The meaningfulness of a theme is assessed by its importance on life.<br /><br />And I just found Proust\u2019s theme 10 very low on that.<br /><br />And so this meaningfully low theme, should not warrant this much damage it is causing to another important theme (nostalgia effect \u2013 because it is too long to get to that). <br /><br />The audience\u2019s comfort to apprehend every themes is not being maximized.<br /><br />--<br /><br />2nd reason why the book is this long- Theme 5: the full loss of his past life (#5):<br /><br /> imagine if a writer had conceptual imagination and structure a narrative where the life span of the individual progresses more quickly while highlighting all of what is already highlighted on Swann\u2019s way (the very first book).<br /><br /><br />But Proust did not want to be bothered with that organization. <br /><br />And This refusal of thematic conception would be okay if what he did had a positive impact on any themes\u2026 but it does not.<br /><br />On a thematic level, the only thing that book 2 ( I repeat nearly a thousand pages), 3, 4, 5 and book 6 contribute is to progress the lifespan of the narrator but slowly. (theme #5)<br /><br /><br />The metaphysical realism of the theme is not even felt by this narrative choice because people\u2019s lives aren\u2019t a series of similar experiences. <br /><br />Narrating them to infinity does not increase the realism of the life experience.<br /><br />So in either cases (if the narrative were shorter, and if the narrative is as long as it is right now), this specific theme of loss of his past life would feel the same to the audience because Proust narrates the exact same types of events.<br /><br />---<br />To me, the length of this book does not have satisfying thematic justifications (a meaningfully low consolation, and an ineffective increase of the realism of a theme).",

    "text": "There are some writers that have made such a unique contribution to literature and to art that they are considered among the best, if not the best, and not just in their own country, but in the world. Such a writer was Marcel Proust. He has been called the greatest novelist of the 20th century, and the novel, A la Recherche du Temps Perdu, compared to Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel ceiling. But Michelangelo was known as \u201cThe Divine\u201d, while Proust was called a hypochondriac, a dilettante, a homosexual and a mama\u2019s boy. All of these things were true, to a certain extent, and when the first volume of In Search of Lost Time (Swann\u2019s Way) was published in 1913, Proust\u2019s friends were shocked that he had produced such a masterpiece. As Marcel himself said, there was not just one Proust, but many, and his many selves were often paradoxical and antithetical to each other. He used the ways of a hypochondriac to make people, mostly his mother, give him special treatment, yet he had his first asthma attack at age nine and struggled with ill health until his death at age 51. He was a social-climbing dilettante yet spent the last ten years of his life as a virtual recluse, shielded from the outside world by the cork-lined walls of his bedroom. He was a homosexual who wrote and spoke as if he deplored homosexuality. And he was a mama\u2019s boy who used the love and anguish of that relationship as a springboard for the novel\u2019s deep and enduring truths about all forms of love and devotion and life and art.<br /><br /> But do we really need to know anything about the writer to understand, or even appreciate, the work itself? Remembrance of Things Past, or as it is more accurately titled now, In Search of Lost Time, is often described as a semi-autobiographical work, so can\u2019t we just read the books to know the man? No, in answer to both questions, but\u2026yes. Although Proust only peripherally identifies the \u201cNarrator\u201d in Lost Time as himself, the book closely parallels his life, possibly a better phrase would be reflects his life (as some key things are reversed, as if seen in a mirror). And at the risk of sounding dramatic, Proust gave this life- mentally &amp; physically- to the service of writing these volumes. He gave the novel his life and in return, it gave him immortality. Proust was aware of this \u201cbargain with the devil\u201d he\u2019d made, and when he wrote fin at the end of the novel, he told his housekeeper/companion \u201cNow I can die\u201d\u2026and shortly afterward, he did. Knowing something of the life of this man can help illuminate the world of Lost Time, as a reading of Lost Time illuminates not just Marcel\u2019s life but all lives, our own included. That\u2019s one of the reasons why this work is regarded as one of the world\u2019s best, and why it is as relevant to us now as it was then and as it will continue to be in the future<br /><br /> In Search of Lost Time actually consists of seven volumes, the first being Swann\u2019s Way. When these volumes were being translated into English, the translator changed the title, A la recherch\u00e9 du Temps Perdu, to a line from Shakespeare, \u201cRemembrance of Things Past\u201d. This is not only a bad interpretation of In Search of Lost Time , it\u2019s not even what the novel is about. Marcel hated it. He didn\u2019t much care for Swann\u2019s Way either, which in French is Du cote de chez Swann, but what could he do? He was only the author. <br /><br />So what is the novel about? And if it\u2019s so great, why do so many people start reading it but give up before they even reach the famous madeleine scene? Is it because of Proust\u2019s famously long sentences (the Proust Society of America says his longest is 958 words &amp; may be the longest sentence in all of literature)? Or because, as one critic complained after the publication of Swann\u2019s Way, that Proust takes fifteen pages to tell how he turns over in bed at night? Yes. But when the long sentences and the seemingly random and rambling passages begin to coalesce into a whole, and the invisible web of past, present and future becomes visible and clear, then the magnitude of this work and the joy of reading it shines through.<br /><br />But what is it about? It's about life, from one life to all lives.",

    "text": "A few scattered thoughts on this book:<br /><br />\u201cReality exists in memory alone.\u201d<br /><br />We instinctively shrink from this thesis, not because it isn\u2019t meaningful, but because it goes against some (perhaps ill-placed and quite materialistic) sense of action that permeates our modern lives. And yet inevitably we should still be drawn to its spell, as who has not felt that joy Proust has described at least once in their lives? Just today I read J\u00f3zef Czapski's remarkable <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40378238-lost-time\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Lost Time: Lectures on Proust in a Soviet Prison Camp</a> and visions and memories of a great book I read earlier this year but have scarcely given a thought to afterwards, Shalamov's equally brutal and beautiful <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41057656-kolyma-stories\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Kolyma Stories</a>, came instantly into my mind unbidden. I remembered the chilly environment I read it in during the height of winter, and more amazingly recalled even my own visions of the book I had while reading it: pines on the slope of a pure white hill just barely thrusting out of the snow, clutching a loaf of bread amidst the machinations of other inmates, and the all too sudden release from captivity only to see signs of your former imprisonment wherever you look and a promise of an even stranger happiness. The contradictory impulse reigns supreme as we Search for this feeling in all aspects of all our lives, whether through art or observation of the laws of man, yet this involuntary sensation must come completely unbidden all the same. The solution presented is quite simple, oft repeated but not often heeded, that we should strive not necessarily for new experiences but for new eyes.<br /><br /><br />This resignation from the present, this active search for a meaning that is inside ourselves runs so counter to our modern values, but instead of struggling against it, perhaps we should seek to take what lessons we can from it, for does not the creation of most, if not all art require a separation from our earthly realities, if only for a moment, to draw upon memory in our solitude?<br /><br /><br />It\u2019s the ultimate Idealist state of existence outside of time when involuntary memory is experienced, and this is generally what this book equally strives to do in art. As Czapski put it, in Proust's book he doesn't simply lay down a bunch of plain facts and laws of humanity, but rather the effect of those facts when it comes in contact with his own head to send off literary sparks and reflections that comprise his work.<br /><br /><br />For our Search and the many states of existence that will inevitably comprise it, and states within states in a long continual line bound only by our feeble consciousness, much suffering is needed. Proust marries the ideas of Goethe and Dostoevsky in Time Regained, a major accomplishment spanning three centuries and perhaps able to only be adequately done by representation, that is to say by fiction. This is already a miracle in itself, and Proust tells it in such prose too that his call to action of all young prospective artists may have the opposite effect of making them wither under the spell of his sentences that one can't even hope to replicate, thereby making a possible shameful imitation even more shameful from how much it will inevitably pale in comparison. It is fine, however, Proust (like Ruskin) acknowledges that first we must cast off our influences to make something truly worthwhile, and it's clear how much Proust himself has swallowed, digested, and spat out writers from every possible milieu to create his work. <br /><br /><br />What art and involuntary memory are is nothing less than a salvation from death. A figure perhaps long forgotten by history is invoked in the character of Swann, reviving the real person for just a moment from oblivion, and my own joy was immense when I rediscovered the pleasure I had at reading the Kolyma Stories, a part of my life that could have been completely swallowed by Time and never remembered otherwise. Thus does an artist play god in a way that concerns the human soul, something that science is yet quite in the dark about.<br /><br /><br />Moreover, the thesis above is not Proust's entire thesis exactly, as Proust is the first one to point out how faulty our memory can be. What matters is artistic invention and construction, panning the gold from the muck of the rest of our life to use it in creation, precisely what Elstir meant thousands of pages ago in the second book of the Search and what the narrator takes much too long to realize himself. This realization is absolutely essential so that the Search itself is not some dull autobiography. Proust in his unbound writing and often unabashed delight in his own sentences on nature, art, and life frees at once the constraints of the novel from its formulaic predecessors and his own soul from the burdens of the society which he frequented and the indifferent bourgeois face he had to put on his whole life. Why have me explain it, however? The most astonishing passage in Time Regained sheds light upon it all, albeit in just as unorganized a fashion as is befitting Proust. That same passage has such a rousing proclamation, the same mentioned earlier in this review, that I think the time for writing reviews is really over, but I will contradict myself further on in this same review.<br /><br /><br />Confirmed public enemy No. 1: Habit. No. 2 it seems is the cursed logic of human intellect, sufficient to be a dish-washer perhaps, but sterile to the imagination.<br /><br /><br />An extraordinary way of seeing this book is a collection of mini-essays, each with no beginning nor end, ceaselessly blending into one other and corroborating the others\u2019 text. This is not so extraordinary in itself until you observe that as evidence for the claims about life, society, and all manners of things in general, Proust uses as evidence the characters and events of his own book, in their essence entirely fictional. And what if they\u2019re based on real people, one must admit that there must be some aspects of people that not even Proust could even begin to infer on and would be easier to invent rather, thereby making Proust\u2019s work a self-containing universe, as Nabokov stated a \u201cfairy-tale\u201d of sorts, a universe not necessarily with laws different from our own, but one which those very laws are transposed and made more fantastic, which is why on seeing some brilliant observation of Proust\u2019s that we have no doubt thought before on our own but in a diminished sense, we exclaim \u201cI couldn\u2019t have said it better myself!\u201d, as if language itself was useless in our dull, present world.<br /><br /><br />In any case ISoLT is an adequate retelling of Paradise Lost, doubtless the most unique we\u2019ll see in our lifetimes as I don't place much faith in adaptations as a rule. Certainly there are better gods to worship.<br /><br /><br />The more I read the more I see the need to record my thoughts on books, being scornful of this concept earlier, but now that I\u2019ve decided, I won\u2019t do things halfway. A book that\u2019s grown in my estimation over time is Sebald\u2019s The Rings of Saturn, and I can\u2019t even be entirely certain what I thought about it as at that time I never wrote it down. Miraculously just seeing the pictures in Sebald's novel is enough to trigger memories of the time and place in which I experienced the book, but alas not of reflections that can often be put down in prose, and my original observation is in fact one of the few things I actually did write down in a status update, so no wonder I remember it!<br /><br /><br />The writing of Proust is as equally as flowery as it is brutal. Despite its often humorous nature the novel is very cruel at times and incredibly despairing, callous, and paranoid at others. A great and complete novel has all these aspects of life however, and of course this one is no exception.<br /><br /><br />A little six page passage in The Captive, in otherwise a quite tiresome part, contains nearly perfect writing, and it turns out is one of the last Proust ever added on. It concerns a description of the painting Proust had said was the most beautiful, Vermeer\u2019s View of Delft, and the death of a certain artist, and there could be no more fitting eulogy and requiem for the creation of art during our too too brief lifespan. Despite what Cormac McCarthy claims about him, no one perhaps understands and writes about death better than Proust.<br /><br /><br />Good old Harold Bloom in an introduction to my edition mentions Shakespeare no less than 10 times in 20 pages, yet his observations that Proust rivals Shakespeare in the amount of characters that one can't sum up in a single phrase or two is entirely correct. One of my personal favorites is Bloch, and the very fact that Proust created such an amusing and serious character at once despite being a relatively secondary one, like some of Dostoevsky\u2019s best, testifies already to the great quality of character writing that most people appreciate him for (and also the additional fact that undoubtedly Proust pokes fun at himself with the character). In this book there could easily be found another, implied but not shown, all about Bloch\u2019s adventures and rise in the literary underworld, perhaps in contrast to the narrators rise in society but absolute inability to write, and I would read it just as eagerly. Another case could be made of the beloved character Saint-Loup, whose personal arc of development in various directions is extremely strong yet is still quite a peripheral character during large swaths of the novel though he could have easily become the protagonist of one, same could be said of characters like the Baron de Charlus, Morel, etc. etc.<br /><br /><br />Many say that Proust changed their point of view on certain aspects of life: for the books we read too and the art we see and hear this is the case, that our view on them can be changed by Proust, and this facet is often overlooked. My entire review for Robert Walser came into my head one day when I was in the process of opening up The Captive. In a most amusing passage Proust makes a genius and unique observation of Dostoevsky\u2019s work that is quite illuminating, but in the next sentence calls Tolstoy a student of Dostoevsky. I had something here in my brief note about the concept of involuntary connectivity in Balzac\u2019s and Wagner\u2019s work but I completely forgot it, so I'll save that for a reread I suppose. <br /><br /><br />Proust mentions that a truth in life can be better expressed when \u201crecomposed\u201d as in music, but also in a work like ISoLT, which makes it greater than any sterile analysis might do. In fact it seems that one of the largest impressions upon Proust that gave way to the genesis of this book was music, just as important if not more so than the madeleine in tea, as Proust has had similar experiences throughout his whole past of this involuntary memory, but would not have been able to recognize the artistic impulse it possessed had he not first recognized this expression of a higher truth in music. So this involuntary recall for the past does not preclude our more classical and Romantic recognition of truth in art; they go hand in hand. Perhaps I may be drawing too similar of a comparison between the narrator and Proust or making assumptions, but they are not without them being based in the text. <br /><br /><br />Despite Proust's great wealth of quotable material, I don't include any here except for the first one as they can be quite odious when read out of context and can often give the completely wrong impression. Rather, I encourage you to read the book and create yourself a batch of quotes from his work and realize what a futile and no doubt tiring effort it has been. Reading just one of his books instead of all seven is like removing a seventh of a sliver of a great painting to look at, still acceptable to an extent, but extracting single quotes one at a time is like taking a splotch of paint or two from small areas and spreading them out before you only to see what an incomprehensible mess you've made out of a masterpiece, and you might as well weep yourself to sleep at night like when Marcel didn't get a good-night's kiss from his mother.",

No, the real reason I hate this book so much is that it established a deeply retarded model of European-American male coolness that continues to plague our culture today.<br /><br />I could go into a lot more depth on this topic, but it's come to my attention that I've been using my horrible addiction to Bookster to avoid the many obligations and responsiblities of my daily life, to which I should now return.

The main reason I hate it is because, for me, reading Kerouac's prose is almost physically painful. I love the ramblings of self-centered drunks when they're self-deprecating, ironic, and/or funny, but Kerouac was none of these things.

    "text": "<b>A View from the Couch</b><br /><br />OTR has received some negative reviews lately, so I thought I would try to explain my rating.<br /><br />This novel deserves to lounge around in a five star hotel rather than languish in a lone star saloon.<br /><br /><b>Disclaimer</b><br /><br />Please forgive my review. It is early morning and I have just woken up with a sore head, an empty bed and a full bladder.<br /><br /><b>Confesssion</b><br /><br />Let me begin with a confession that dearly wants to become an assertion.<br /><br />I probably read this book before most of you were born.<br /><br />So there!<br /><br />Wouldn't you love to say that!<br /><br />If only I had the courage of my convictions.<br /><br />Instead, I have only convictions, and they are many and varied.<br /><br />However, I am sure that by the end of my (this) sentence, I shall be released.<br /><br /><b>Elevated to the Bar</b><br /><br />I read OTR in my teens, which were spread all over the end of the 60's and the beginning of the 70's.<br /><br />My life was dominated by Scouting for Boys.<br /><br />I mean the book, not the activity.<br /><br />My mantra was \"be prepared\", although at the time I didn't realise that this actually meant \"be prepared for war\".<br /><br />After reading OTR, my new mantra was \"be inebriated\".<br /><br />Mind you, I had no idea what alcohol tasted like, but it sounded good.<br /><br />Gone were two boys in a tent and three men in a boat.<br /><br />OTR was about trying to get four beats in a bar, no matter how far you'd travelled that day.<br /><br /><b>Typing or Writing</b><br /><br />Forget whether it was just typing rather than writing.<br /><br />That was just Truman Capote trying to dot one of Dorothy Parker's eyes.<br /><br />This is like focusing on the mince instead of the sausage.<br /><br /><b>All Drums and Symbols</b><br /><br />You have to appreciate what OTR symbolised for people like me.<br /><br />It was \"On the Road\", not \"In the House\" or \"In the Burbs\".<br /><br />It was about dynamism, not passivity.<br /><br />It wasn't about a stream of consciousness, it was about a river of activity.<br /><br />It was about \"white light, white heat\", not \"white picket fences\".<br /><br /><b>Savouring the Sausage</b><br /><br />OK, your impressions are probably more recent than mine.<br /><br />Mine are memories that have been influenced by years of indulgence. (I do maintain that alcohol kills the unhealthy brain cells first, so it is actually purifying your brain.)<br /><br />I simply ask that you overlook the mince and savour the sausage.<br /><br /><b>Beyond Ephemerality</b><br /><br />I would like to make one last parting metaphor.<br /><br />I have misappropriated it from the musician, Dave Graney.<br /><br />He talks about \"feeling ephemeral, but looking eternal\".<br /><br />Dave comes from the Church of the Latter Day Hipsters.<br /><br />He is way cooler than me, he even looks great in leather pants, in a spivvy kinda way.<br /><br />However, I think the point he was making (if not, then the point I am making) is that most of life is ephemeral. It just happens and it's gone forever.<br /><br />However, in Dave's case, the way he looks, the way he feels, he turns it into something eternal.<br /><br />It's his art, his music, our pleasure, our memories (at least until we die).<br /><br /><b>Footnotes on Cool</b><br /><br />Creativity and style are our last chance attempt to defy ephemerality and mortality and become eternal.<br /><br />Yes, all that stuff between the bookends of OTR might be typing, it might be preserving ephemerality that wasn't worthy or deserving.<br /><br />However, the point is the attempt to be your own personal version of cool.<br /><br />Heck, no way am I cool like the Beats or James Dean or Marlon Brando or Jack Nicholson or Clint Eastwood or Keith Richards or Camille Paglia.<br /><br />However, I am trying to live life beyond the ephemeral.<br /><br />That's what OTR means to me. <br /><br />If it doesn't mean that to you, hey, that's alright. I'm OK, you're OK. It's cool.<br /><br />Original posted: March 01, 2011<br /> ",

    "text": "This is the book which has given me anxiety attacks on sleepless nights.<br />This is the book which has glared at me from its high pedestal of classical importance in an effort to browbeat me into finally finishing it. <br />And this is that book which has shamed me into feigning an air of ignorance every time I browsed any of the countless <i>1001-books-to-read-before-you-die</i> lists.<br /><br />Yes Jack Kerouac, you have tormented me for the past 3 years and every day I couldn't summon the strength to open another page of 'On the Road' and subject my brain to the all-too-familiar torture of Sal's sleep-inducing, infuriatingly monotonous narration. <br /><br />Finally, I conquer you after nearly 3 years of dithering. I am the victorious one in the battle in which you have relentlessly assaulted my finer senses with your crassness and innate insipidity and dared me to plod on. I can finally beat my chest in triumph (ugh pardon the Tarzan-ish metaphor but a 1-star review deserves no better) and announce to the world that I have finished reading <i>'On the Road'</i>. Oh what an achievement! And what a monumental waste of my time.<br /><br />Dear Beat Generation classic, I can finally state without any fear of being called out on my ignorance that I absolutely hated reading you. Every moment of it. <br /><br />Alternatively, this book can be named <i>White Heterosexual Man's Misadventures and Chauvinistic Musings</i>. And even that makes it sound much more interesting and less offensive than it actually is. <br /><br />In terms of geographical sweep, the narrative covers nearly the whole of America in the 50s weaving its way in and out of Los Angeles and New York and San Francisco and many other major American cities. Through the eyes of Salvatore 'Sal' Paradise, a professional bum, we are given an extended peek into the lives of a band of merry have-nots, their hapless trysts with women, booze, drugs, homelessness, destitution, jazz as they hitchhike and motor their way through the heart of America. <br />Sounds fascinating right? (Ayn Rand will vehemently disagree though). <br /><br />But no, it's anything but that. Instead this one just shoves Jack Kerouac's internalized white superiority, sexism and homophobia right in the reader's face in the form of some truly bad writing. This book might as well come with a caption warning any potential reader who isn't White or male or straight. I understand that this was written way before it became politically incorrect to portray women in such a poor light or wistfully contemplate living a \"Negro's life\" in the antebellum South. But there's an obvious limit to the amount of his vile ruminations I can tolerate.<br /><blockquote>\n  <i>\"There was an old Negro couple in the field with us. They picked cotton with the same God-blessed patience their grandfathers had practiced in ante-bellum Alabama.\"</i>\n</blockquote><br />Seriously? God-blessed patience? <br /><br />Every female character in this one is a vague silhouette or a caricature of a proper human being. Marylou, Camille, Terry, Galatea are all frighteningly one-dimensional - they never come alive for the reader through Sal's myopic vision. They are merely there as inanimate props reduced to the status of languishing in the background and occasionally allowed to be in the limelight when the men begin referring to them as if they were objects.<br />Either they are 'whores' for being as sexually liberated as the men are or they are screaming wives who throw their husbands out of the house for being jobless, cheating drunks or they are opportunistic and evil simply because they do not find Sal or Dean or Remy or Ed or any of the men in their lives to be deserving of their trust and respect, which they truly aren't.<br /><br />And sometimes, they are only worthy of only a one or two-line description like the following:-<br /><blockquote>\n  <i>\"...I had been attending school and romancing around with a girl called Lucille, a beautiful Italian honey-haired darling that I actually wanted to marry\"</i>\n</blockquote><br />Look at Sal talking about a woman as if she were a breed of cat he wanted to rescue from the animal shelter. <br /><blockquote>\n  <i>\"Finally he came out with it: he wanted me to work Marylou.\"</i>\n</blockquote> <br />Is Marylou a wrench or a machine of some kind? <br /><br />And this is not to mention the countless instances of <i>'get you a girl', 'get girls', 'Let's get a girl'</i> and other minor variations of the same strewn throughout the length of the book and some of Sal's thoughts about 'queers' which are equally revolting. <br /><br />Maybe I am too much of a non-American with no ties to a real person who sees the Beat era through the lenses of pure nostalgia or maybe I am simply incapable of appreciating the themes of youthful wanderlust and living life with a perverse aimlessness or maybe it's the flat writing and appalling representation of women. Whatever the real reason(s) maybe, I can state with conviction that this is the only American classic which I tried to the best of my abilities to appreciate but failed.",

    "text": "I think this book, which launched Kerouac's career and gave him insta-fame, has to be seen as a product of its time.<br /><br />I found it a chore to read, a long dull boast about a series of road trips. It's populated by vacuous largely despicable alcoholics with zero impulse control and an unshakeable belief that they are deeply profound observers of the human condition.<br /><br />One saving grace of the book is that Kerouac has an unusual writing style with a strong voice that he uses well, especially when describing the landscapes and cities as his avatar rushes to and fro across America. <br /><br />The other is that the 'shocking' nature of the book back in 1955, immersed in drugs, alcohol, and sexuality, five years before a court case finally allowed the rather tame <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/34230427.Lady_Chatterley_s_Lover\" title=\"Lady Chatterley's Lover by D.H. Lawrence\" rel=\"noopener\">Lady Chatterly's Lover</a> to be published in the UK, 32 years after it was written, has been replaced with a certain historical interest in the modern reader seeing how things worked over 60 years ago.<br /><br />The book garnered so much interest because it was said to capture zeitgeist of the beat generation - it variously explained and/or titillated with an under the hood look at the youth movement of the late 40s/early 50s that led into rock and roll and on into hippydom. We also see the young white male characters mixing with African Americans and Hispanics decades before the civil rights movement.<br /><br />Kerouac's avatar, Sal Paradise, follows Dean Moriarty, a hollow messiah of the age, and together they haunt jazz and bop clubs trying to capture \"it\" and waxing ecstatically about saxophonists blowing.<br /><br />We see several years of the pair's directionless lives, Dean oscillating between three women, spawning and abandoning children, dropping everything repeatedly on a whim to cross America east to west or back again, and finally to Mexico City.<br /><br />The pair cheat and steal their way while claiming to savour the goodness of those they encounter. Dean has to be warned off the 13 year old daughter of a friend, and later in Mexico they sleep with 15 year old prostitutes.<br /><br />In a manner familiar in Dickens and Dostoevsky, and more recently echoed by Rothfuss, our characters are always penniless, generally because if they get money they spend it at a ridiculous rate until they have none.<br /><br />Dean and Sal are characterised by a refusal to look beyond the next hour. The consequences of their actions are of little concern to them because they feel no responsibility for them.<br /><br />I realise that I sound like a scolding schoolmarm, the epitome of everything this book was likely a reaction to. But after hundreds of pages of having their reaction forced down my throat I have my own reaction back against it. No, I don't dig it. <br /><br />And it being a travelogue based on real experience there is of course no plot and as it turns out no real sense of progression, which led to the book feeling rather samey after a while. It was apparently hand written on a roll of wallpaper and it really does feel rather like a long list of \"and then and then and then\".<br /><br />I was moved to try Kerouac back in the 80s by a line in a Marillion song, \"read some Kerouac and it put me on the track to burn a little brighter now\". Yes, this is a book about living at full throttle (and much of it is spent shooting across the States at 110mph), about burning the candle at both ends, about not living a milk toast life, it shouts at you \"what are you saving yourself for?\" and those ideas of course hold a certain appeal. But then again, when you look at the sad sacks in this book ... maybe not.<br /><br />The second star is for the quality of the prose. In fact both of them are.<br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/marklawrenceauthor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Join my Patreon</a><br /> <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/cimnK1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes</a><br /><br /><br /><br />..",

    "text": "I've been thinking about this book a lot lately, so I figured that I'd go back and write something about it. <br /><br />When I first read this book, I loved it as a piece of art, but its effect on me was different than I expected. So many people hail Kerouac as the artist who made them quit their jobs and go to the road, become a hippie or a beat and give up the rest. When I read it though, I had been completely obsessed with hippie culture for a long time, and it caused me to steer away from it for a while. While I thought that it would be a rollicking tale of freedom and glory, I found that all of Dean's conquests were tainted by the fact that he had to take advantage of other people every step of the way. He was a hugely entertaining character, but would have been a terrible friend, lover, or even acquaintance. From the women he married to gas station attendents, right down to Sal Paradise himself, Dean drained everything that he was right out of other people, and it eventually ruined him. It left him beat...not heart beating exhilarated, but beat up, dead beat and alone. Once I stepped back a little from the awe at Dean's greatness, this book was really sad, and it caused me to put away that romanticism for a while.<br /><br />Now, 2 years later, though, On the Road is coming back to me full on. I didn't escape the total wonder at the Beats and the road. I have been <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road\" title=\"The Road by Cormac McCarthy\" rel=\"noopener\">on the road</a> myself for the last 2 months and have a long way to go before I get back home, and I am constantly aware that the the way was paved by Kerouac and the rest of the crazy geniuses of his generation. The road is every bit as romantic as Sal Paradise made it out to be, and its glory far out weighs the short comings of Dean as a friend. I mean, the road is a lot like Dean, it takes a lot out of you, but you get addicted to it and obsessed with it and can't let it go, and I don't think there's any other way about it. I am in love with America for the first time. Now that I've seen it, driven across and up and down, around and over America, I find it sublime and incredible. I think that Kerouac and his friends might've been the first to see that. Maybe not. Maybe they are just part of all of American history...they translated the world of Western expansion and canvas covered wagons into the way of the modern world. America is something to dream about. It is worthy every exuberant and formerly offensive \"I'm proud\" sticker that's plastered on the back of a pick up truck. And Kerouac saw that first hand. So, it seems, that there is a certain tragedy in this book, but that it is less important than the unavoidable glory that you come to associate with the road and freedom after following these guys on their crazy adventure. I think this book should be read by everyone who wants to know about America.",

    "text": "Kerouac's masterpiece breathes youth and vigor for the duration and created the American bohemian \"beat\" lifestyle which has been the subject of innumerable subsequent books, songs, and movies. I have read this at least two or three times and always feel a bit breathless and invigorated because of the restlessness of the text and the vibrance of the characters. There was an extraordinary exhibit at the Pompidou Center earlier this year where the original draft in Kerouac's handwriting was laid out end to end in a glass case. It was like seeing the original copy of Don Quixote in the royal palace in Madrid - very moving. In any case, there is no excuse not to read this wonderful high point of mid-20th century American literature.<br /><br />Re-read and found both beauty and sadness in this work. The sadness stems from the sexism, racism, and homophobia expressed throughout the book. Sign of the times, I know, but it is still painful to see that these Beat visionaries - for all their open-mindedness towards other religions and sex and drugs - still expressed such backwards views and attitudes sometimes <br /><br />As for the beauty, the story of Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty crossing the US again and again with a last trip down to Mexico City is epic.<br /><br />\"I pictured myself in a Denver bar that night, with all the gang, and in their eyes I would be strange and ragged and like the Prophet who has walked across the land to bring the dark Word, and the only Word I had was \"Wow!\" (P. 37)<br /><br />I have driven from Florida to San Francisco by myself and back again when I was in college and felt that Kerouac captured the enthusiasm that the memory still evokes in me:<br /><br />\"I thought, and looked every, as I had looked everywhere in the little world below. And before me was the great raw bulge and bulk of my American continent\" (P. 79)<br /><br />The descriptions of bebop jazz are absolutely astounding throughout as they listen to Prez, Bird, Dizzy...<br />\"The pianist was only pounding the keys with spread-eagled fingers, chords, or at intervals when the great tenorman was drawing breath for another blast--Chinese chords, shuddering the piano in every timber, chink, and wire, boing!\" (P. 197)<br /><br />The writing makes you feel the musics energy pulsating and driving - that is one of my favorite aspects of <u>On the Road</u>:<br /><br />\"Holy flowers floating in the air, were all these tired forms in the dawn of Jazz America.\" (P. 204)<br /><br />Other moments are surreal and yet moments I have known many times:<br /><br />\"Just about that time a strange thing began to haunt me. It was this: I had forgotten something. There was a decision that I was about to make before Dean showed up, and now it was driven clear out of my mind but still hung on the tip of my mind's tongue.\" (P. 124)<br /><br />Or the feeling of mystery:<br /><br />\"This was a manuscript of the night that we couldn't read.\" (P. 158) and those that do not share their trip on the road \"they stand uncertainly underneath immense skies, and everything about them is drowned.\" (P. 167)<br /><br />I perhaps just ignored it in my previous readings, but this time I was struck by the heroin references. Old Bill was off in the bathroom tying up and yet taking care of his kids (alarming!) <br /><br />Perhaps the predominant mood and attitude of the book and Kerouac's view of the period is summarized on Sal's 3rd trip to San Francisco:<br /><br />\"I realized that I had died and been reborn numberless times but just didn't remember especially because the transitions from life to death and back to life are so ghostly easy, a magical action for naught, like falling asleep and waking up again a million times, the utter casualness and deep ignorance of it. I realized it was only because of the stability of the intrinsic Mind that these ripples of birth and death took place, like the action of wind on a sheet of pure, serene, mirror-like water. I felt a sweet, swinging bliss like a big shot of heroin in the mainline vein; like a gulp of wine late in the afternoon and it makes you shudder; my feet tingled.\" (P. 173)<br /><br />Kerouac captured the spirit of the Beats who would later become the hippies of the 60's (but without the Vietnam War) in both its glory and its squalor. The book is both beautiful and uplifting and desperate and depressing. Regardless of how one reacts to it, it is truly one of the great works of the expression of the American spirit in the post-WWII period.",

I dreaded each time I had to read this.<br /><br />On The Road is a book about a young man named Sal who hitches rides across the country, giggling, having a string of meaningless relationships with characters that never reappear, and Sal worshipping his bestie, Dean, who has very little redeeming qualities.<br /><br />The beginning of this book was promising. I thought it was going to be like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but it wasn\u2019t funny. <br /><br />In terms of a travelogue, this isn\u2019t it.

Coupling this with \"Huck Finn\" as THE quintessential American Novel is One Enormous mistake: Twain at least entertains, at least follows through with his intention, with his American take on the Quixotean legend; Kerouac might just be the biggest literary quack of the 20th century! The book is awkward, structured not as ONE single trip, but composed of a few coast-to-coast coastings, all having to do with this overused motif.<br /><br />I despise it. (Living in Denver, Kerouactown, makes me hate him more!) A tale of a closeted individual who really has nothing to say. He has glorified a ruffian (DEAN DEAN DEAN... DEAN!) whose selfishness sits well with him. What Sal does say, however, ever so dully, is just how Cool those around him are, how his only addition to this incomprehensible BEAT movement is as lame as those of a newspaper photographer: he sees and reports, jots idle musings down. What he fails to understand (the main guy is not even YOUNG... [he is old &amp; stupid, desperate &amp; pathetic]!!!) is how entirely false this sense of freedom can be: Can a sheep really outwit the shepherd? Here's a supreme example of the blind leading... I sternly refuse to follow such idiotic drivel. This is a book for followers written by a Conformist, for one can always be some selfproclaimed comfortable conformist of nonconformism.<br /><br />Nothing sticks.

    "text": "Although the ideas hold a certain appeal, this book is ultimately just a half-assed justification of some pretty stupid, self-destructive, irresponsible, and juvenile tendencies and attitudes, the end result of which is a validation of being a deadbeat loser, a perpetual child. This validation is dressed up as a celebration of freedom etc. <br /><br />As literary art, stylistically, the book is pretty bad. The analogies to bebop or even free jazz are misguided. That improvisation was by talented musicians, or at least musicians who understood music, had a remarkable ear. Kerouac is just rambling and he thinks that qualifies as the literary equivalent of jazz improv. It doesn't. It's just tiresome. DeLillo's prose is an example of prose that more accurately can be described as analogous to bebop. <br /><br />I'm not going to hold it against anyone that they like this book. I know that it influenced some important and serious artists, who were many times Kerouac's superiors. I understand its appeal, and even its historical importance. But reading it today, and not being 16 anymore, it really is a bit of a joke. <br /><br />Its importance in itself, too, has faded. The Beats live on as myth that surpasses, for the most part, their actual output in both resonance and quality. Moreover, their myth has been adapted, especially in popular music, so well that it has rendered a lot of their actual work trivial, especially the lesser Beats (in terms of talent), eg. Kerouac. Nobody needs to read <i>On the Road</i> anymore, and all it's going to do is perpetuate some pretty idiotic notions we already have enough of, and lead to a lot of ripoffs of ripoffs of Whitman thinking their poetry is important and crowding bars I don't want to have to see them at. <br /><br />Just look at contemporary literature, the voices we have, the stuff that's selling well on the literary market. A lot of that stuff is just workshop fiction that isn't going to last long in particular well-regard, but a lot of it is brilliant stuff, and far more literate, intelligent, and interesting than what this guy had to offer. <br /><br />This book's time is up. Aside from youth clinging to a false nostalgia for a nonexistent time and place and crowd, its appeal is pretty much done too. ",

We would stop and camp out by the road, eating pie and drinking beer with multi-vitamins.<br /><br />\u201cWe got to my girlfriend\u2019s house, and we looked like shit. We hadn\u2019t shaved and we had the pie sweats. But, it made me an expert at pie.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cmmmm, pie.\u201d<br /><br />Other than his advice about pie, I find Jack Kerouac to be one of those useless, narcissistic, cult-leader types. He\u2019s pretty hot, though, and he does have correct opinions about pie.",

I read it for the second time because I thought I was too young to have understood it when I read it the first time. It turns out the book is still not good, and Jack Kerouac is still an asshole. For the past three days, I've been opening this edit box and closing it. Because honestly, I couldn't bear the thought of going through my notes, my notes filled with Kerouac's insipid, yet simultaneously aggravating thoughts. I mean, I did read this twice! Two whole times. That's a lot of hours I'll never get back. Nevertheless, I stopped procrastinating, and decided that like ripping a band aid, it's best I get done with this as quickly as possible. Because after this, I'm never touching this book again. Fuck this book.<br /><br />There are books that I dislike because of the language. There are books that I dislike because they're too cheesy. There's books that I think are too good or too bad to be true and so I dislike them too. Then there are books like this that I dislike, because seriously, what the fuck was the writer thinking? It reads like nothing more than an ode to his superior intelligence, his friends' superior intelligence, and their collective \"intellectual and sexual prowess\". Fuck this book.<br /><br />I really don't like stereotypes. I try consciously to not stereotype. But this book could only and only have been written by a White, heterosexual male. Actually, make that American, White, heterosexual male. I mean, anyone who says that the millennial generation is self-obsessed should be asked to read this book. Never have I read a book so complacent, so self-centered. Honestly, no one thinks Sal (Jack) and his friends are the pinnacle of intellectual evolution more than Sal and his friends. What makes it worse is Sal's constant undermining of his own intelligence, which very plainly looks like he's trying to talk about how smart he is without sounding like an idiot. Emphasis on \"trying\", because by god, does he fail miserably at it. Fuck this book.<br /><br />It could've been funny, maybe even a little charming. But Kerouac all spends his time trying to build up this aura of intellect, only for it collapse on itself inelegantly. How anyone could idolise Dean Moriarty is beyond me. He is nothing more than a self-serving egomaniac (and nymphomaniac) who would probably pimp out his mother for a bottle of whiskey and a pack of Parliaments. The problem is, I've actually met people who're as bad, and the end result is nowhere as literarily perfect as it is in this book. Fuck this book. <br /><br />Don't even get me started on the portrayal of the female characters in this book. Because there is no \"portrayal\", really. Despite his claims of having been with more women than I can count on my fingers, Sal's understanding of women is painfully pedestrian. On reading the description of the women in this book, I can only conclude that these characters were written by an alien ghostwriter who had a very vague idea of what women actually were. They are reduced to caricatures of what someone else must have described as \"women\". They're either whores or prudes. Easy or difficult. Hot or fat. In Sal, and in fact, his friends' eyes, women exist to satisfy their sexual needs. Worse still, women are okay with being reduced to mere sexual objects. Never have I seen a man so tone-deaf about what women are since Henry VIII created a new religion to satisfy his sexual appetite. Fuck this book.<br /><br />I say in many books that it is me, and not the book. Here, it is the book. The combination of smug intellectual superiority, and utter and total disregard for anyone who isn't white, heterosexual, or male makes this book truly one of the worst I've read. There is the unnecessary glorification of criminal acts, of ruffians, of drugs, of addiction, of sex; gratuitous idolisation of people one really shouldn't be idolsing. Kerouac perhaps pulled off perhaps the world's greatest literary scam in getting this book published. It isn't great in any way. I don't even think it is truly representative of Beat Culture. Kerouac should've just stuck to naming the Beat Generation and left the writing to his friends. That is truly a better contribution to literature than this awful book. Considering this book a Great American Novel would be trivialising the contribution of America to the world of literature. FUCK. THIS. BOOK.",

In fact, <b>it is not a plot-driven novel at all</b>. You follow Jack Kerouac's travels throughout America and Mexico, and that's it. What captivates you is his <b>writing style</b>, a writing style the likes of which I had never encountered. You'll notice a plethora of <b>contradictions</b>: it can be <b>lyrical</b> and so beautiful it makes you hold your breath, and want to absorb every detail, every smell and sound and feeling, and then you'll come across so many traces of oral speech, that you're certain you're listening to a conversation full of curse words and half-finished sentences right next to you; you can sense Kerouac's admiration towards his country and at the same time his bitterness and disappointment; you can feel his loneliness to your marrow, and then the camaraderie that keeps him going. You will find your lips curling into a smile, but then a heaviness will settle on your chest, a near sadness because you see those people searching for <i>something</i>, anything, and when they find it, it slips from their fingers. You contemplate your own morality and mortality, question the meaning of ideals when life is too short and full of misery. When the road lies ahead full of possibilities, and you're lost and bound and torn.<br /><blockquote>\n  <b>\n    <i>\u201cBecause he had no place he could stay in without getting tired of it and because there was nowhere to go but everywhere, keep rolling under the stars...\u201d </i>\n  </b>\n</blockquote><br />When you read <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/70401.On_the_Road\" title=\"On the Road by Jack Kerouac\" rel=\"noopener\">On the Road</a>, at first you're a little judgmental towards the characters. But as the story progresses, you are envious of their <b>carelessness</b>, their <b>crazy and wild abandon</b>, their desire to live even when they don't know what they live for. You don't read it for the plot, but you read it for its moments, its <b>vigorous, bright and mesmerising moments</b>, mornings eating apple-pie with ice-cream, dirty streets in an alcohol frenzy, a young man on the top of a mountain with the world at his feet, a mexican brothel shaking by the sounds of mambo, cold nights drinking scotch under a crystal clear sky. In the end, it all comes to one thing: <b>we are the sum of the people we meet</b>. Some of them are destined to change us, draw us to them like moths to the flame.

It seems like almost every city in the United States is mentioned at least once as Sal Paradise tells of his travels, the people he meets, those who join him, and his wild vagabond companion Dean Moriarity. I don't feel like the style of this book will appeal to everyone and I can easily see many losing interest part way in. But, if you are a fan of travelling in America, a scholar of literary genres, a hipster, and/or grew up in the 50s travelling the great American highways before interstates, you will find something in here for you. <br><br>There is also a lot of jazz influence in the writing. Several times the writing comes to a stop for an onomatopoedic side trip to a jazz club. This was especially interesting as I was listening to the audio. <br><br>Dean Moriarity - if nothing else, this book is worth it for Dean. The fact that Dean was based on a real person (Kerouac's friend Neal Cassady) makes his hijinks and destructive personality even more interesting. I am sure that he is a character that is idolized by some who read this, which is a bit scary! (Reminds me of those who idolize Alexander Supertramp from <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/1845.Into_the_Wild\" title=\"Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer\" rel=\"noopener\">Into the Wild</a>)<br><br>An interesting thing that happened while listening to this is twice I thought \"this is reminding me of Hemingway\" and less than a minute later, Hemingway is mentioned. It really reminded me of <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/3876.The_Sun_Also_Rises\" title=\"The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway\" rel=\"noopener\">The Sun Also Rises</a> and Wkipedia mentions that Kerouac did intentionally use the style of that book for On The Road.<br><br>Finally, as mentioned above, Kerouac based this on his life While listed as fiction, up until the final draft, the main characters had real names. The draft the Kerouac used was on long scroll without formatting or paragraph breaks. I mentioned the jazz influence and Kerouac apparently used the scroll in this way to mimic improvisational jazz. Sometimes the scroll can be seen on display - see photo below: <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1499631208i/23253354.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>All in all a very interesting book with very interesting characters and a very interesting history.",

However, I do think there is more to this story.<br /><br />Sure, they are jerks and they are bums and they are full of a lot of BS but as the book progresses, it becomes clear that they know it. These guys are also WW2 vets, and very dissimilar to the hippies who follow them, they do not have any anti-American or anti-establishment feelings. Also, they show a deep remorse and guilt over their actions. There is a shame, because they recognize what jerks they are. After several weeks of living with the mexican girl and her son, the narrator deserts her and he knows that he'll never live up to his promise to come back. He hates himself for this but it doesn't stop him. While he so desperately seeks to squeeze the wonder out of life, he lets everything really beautiful-such as love with a woman or any real human relationships slip from his careless grasp. The narrator as more of a terribly sad man, not just a happy-go-lucky thrill seker.<br /><br />I do wonder about the real life Dean Moriarty. Did you realize that he was the bus driver in Wolfe's Electric Kool-aid Acid Test as well as mentioned in several Grateful Dead songs? Something about that guy really insprired the artisits around him.<br /><br />As for the writing, it is beautiful and I think some of the best writing ever done about America.

    "text": "Here\u2019s the thing : there\u2019s a time to read Kerouac, and it\u2019s not your thirties. I first read \u201cOn the Road\u201d when I was 19 and I loved how meandering and crazy it was\u2026 and in retrospect, I know it\u2019s because I was similarly scattered and unhinged. When one\u2019s in that headspace, it\u2019s natural to appreciate that there\u2019s a classic out there that captures the sort of spontaneous madness that most people only experience in the first half of their twenties. I re-read it when I was twenty-two, and I still thought it was brilliant. Reading it at thirty-three made me cringe way more than I had imagined it would\u2026<br /><br />In historical context, what Kerouac did with this book was revolutionary and it\u2019s important to remember that: the book is dynamic, it threw caution and literary standards to the wind and ran as far and as fast as it could from what Jack considered to be \u201cestablishment\u201d. And on that basis, it's worth checking out.<br /><br />Of course nothing that goes on in this book makes a lick of sense to me now. The lifestyle these characters have is beyond unsustainable and their carelessness with each other is actually quite distressing. And while obviously, the way male characters handle female characters infuriated me, the ladies in this book don\u2019t have much in the way of redeeming qualities either: being \u201cfree\u201d is all nice and good, but it should never ever mean treating other human beings like garbage. And there is a copious amount of that in \u201cOn the Road\u201d, which made me really sad. It\u2019s no secret that this is a roman \u00e0 clef and that most of the events described in the novel are a version of something that actually happened, and these people creating so much suffering for themselves and those around them weighs the book down like an anchor. The idolization of Dean Moriarty \u2013 who is an epic douchewaffle \u2013 is definitely the part that was the hardest to digest this time around. Not to mention the glaring hypocrisy and pseudo-intellectual pretentiousness.<br /><br />The hallucinatory descriptions of trips, both physical and psychological are still entrancing and often poetic, even when they are incoherent. As an ode to freewheeling youth, it has moments of inspiring and lyrical bravado. But I can\u2019t escape the knowledge that all of Sal Paradise\u2019s promises are empty, and that Kerouac never truly found what he was looking for.<br /><br />I\u2019ll be revisiting his other books eventually, to see if they hold up on their own, but do yourself a favor: if you read this book when you were young(er) and loved it, leave it alone.",

    "text": "Rarely has it been so difficult, even painful, to come to the end of a text of 400 pages! So let me explain: the version of On The Road by Jack Kerouac is that of the original roll (1951). This roll, which did a lot for the legend of Kerouac, was written in just three weeks!<br />We omit to specify that Kerouac had been working on this novel for two or even three years and that it was in a mad frenzy (doped with coffee!) He wrote this roll in one go after gluing each sheet individually. Of paper to make a single strip, thus assimilating it to the mythical route of Route 66, the one that crosses the USA from east to west; continuous reading, without the shadow of a paragraph, is perhaps a parallel with the monotony of this route 66 but that its text is long, long.<br />I would only add that this clean text, rendered in a standard format, was published about five years later; the political and economic context of the USA was different. And the crazy American youth who discovered it then found there may be different aspirations\u2014those of Kerouac when he was writing this novel.<br />Kerouac lives alone in New York with his mother after his father died in the story. Disembarks Neal Cassidy, a young thug but irresistible in his appetite to live, I would even say consume his life from all ends. Always with a woman, two or even three, he randomly consumes alcohol, marijuana, and benzedrine sex and moves without stopping !! He will be the black angel of Kerouac, weaving with him during their crazy hikes, bonds so strong that we can them believe indissoluble.<br />So in the car, go for a ride, walk, sniff, drink, fuck, in the order you want, separately or simultaneously!<br />Here we are in Paris with these knocking-off things, little or no adventures, but the road, pubs, drugs, girls, and the text becomes MAGICAL music, jazz, and bebop. But, just for these few pages, the detour is worth it.<br />So, a tedious reading, I did not go into Kerouac's speech old-fashioned, but I assume it. Do we have to come to these great states of disrepair to appreciate life? It isn't my conception, the question of age and period. Indeed, I ask myself the question to say that the text would have aged a little.",

Freedom, man! Back to Nature, one with Nature. At its best the writing was a celebration of all that is good in life, of love, of intoxications and lusts of various kinds. On the road! Romantic. Ecstatic. 5 stars.<br /><br />At 30 I read it again to see if it was still vibrant and relevant and happy to be all alive. I was looking for a touchstone, spinning out of control, recently divorced, directionless, had bought (what I thought was, for no clear reason) a hot car, spent money I didn't have on a cool stereo system, started to live and drink and drive faster and faster. I had been teaching at that point eight years; My life was in a crisis of my own making. I was deeply disappointed in myself as what I read in the writing not only didn't reinforce my bad choices but reflected on my own excesses and mistakes and sadness; I found the writing turgid, narcissistic, badly edited, somewhat misogynist, drunken wastrel prose, though I saw better this time in it the deep sadness underlying the wild surface. I thought it was writing of a certain time in your life, but when you grow up you leave those childish things behind. I tried to get my life together and went to grad school. On the road, eh. I had found it in some ways juvenile and about selfish individualism this time, mine and his. 2 stars.<br /><br />At 60 I am in my 38th year of teaching, now in my happy third marriage, with five kids I feel I am lucky to have and be able to support who all still love me. I am happy to be alive and healthy. I survived some very rocky years when much worse might have ensued. So when I took a road trip with my friend George to see my friend Corey in Boston and see Fenway Park, a bucket list item, we had a blast (notwithstanding a poem I wrote about it that makes fun of all the high expectations amidst all the rain). Loved the trip. We visited Kerouac's gravesite in Lowell and in the mist of the day hovered over George's IPhone to listen to Kerouac's own voice reading his words from \"October in the Railroad Earth.\" <br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hjPZpaXNsw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hjPZ...</a><br /><br />The prose I find on my third reading is poetic, deeply committed to working class and democratic values, and a celebration of life. When I get home I start to reread all the Kerouac I still have in the house, including On the Road, which I find I love like an old friend I have had been \"on the outs\" with, as my Dad used to say. We are pals again, we love being on the road! Romantic, just what I need in this phase of my life, connecting passionate language to life. It's a little uneven, it's not always really great language or storytelling, it feels sometimes like a young man's diary, but I also like that for the immediacy of that, too, and it is important to me for the joy and sadness in it. 4 stars. Not because it is one of the greatest books of all time for all people. It's a \"boy book\" in what are sometimes painful ways to read, because the women always seem peripheral to the men. But 4 stars + because it is a very personal book right now for me, speaking to me in ways I need to listen to, especially the darker aspects of it, when it veers dangerously close to madness and regret.<br /><br />Jack Kerouac reading from On the Road in the surreal circumstance of an appearance on The Steve Allen Show:<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LLpNKo09Xk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LLpN...</a>",

    "text": "I don't normally read fan fiction on Wattpad. One Direction fanfiction, even less so. But given that this trilogy nearly has one BILLION reads altogether, I thought to myself: this can't be that bad -- after all, it's literally the most popular unpublished trilogy on the internet right now. I should give it a try.<br /><br />And I regret it. I'm never again judging a book by its popularity. I honestly have no idea how the movie rights for this were bought, much less how a Big Six publishing house like Simon &amp; Schuster actually agreed to publish it! The plot is like the other 90% of the stories on wattpad involving good girls and bad boys, only it includes the infamous Harry Styles, which is probably the only reason why it has accumulated so many views. And let me tell you, I can name at least thirty stories that are based on the same idea but are written ten times better. Yet somehow they didn't make Wattpad blow up as much as After did.<br /><br />They say that this is the new 50 shades of grey. I admit that I haven't read James' books but the situation does seem similar: 50 shades was initially a Twilight fan fiction, was it not? And this 1D fanfic is ''the next big thing'' with bidders for the movie and the publishing rights. God forbid it ever became a best seller. Books like A Proscriptive Relationship, Love at Last Sight, Late Summer Rain: that's what Wattpad's about, and that's what should be made popular by Wattpad. If After gets published with ''made popular by Wattpad'' on its front cover, I will be very disappointed because the last thing I want to see is fiction like this representing a community filled with brilliant authors.<br /><br />This, however, was so poorly written that I'm having a hard time grasping how the editor is going to make it better. Not only that, but the plot itself lacks any depth whatsoever: at least some of the similar stories I've read actually carried a message. <br /><br />This story does not. <br /><br />It is not based on love, it is based on lust. It does not portray an honest and evolving relationship. Instead, it's centered around a boy with serious anger management issues and a lovestruck girl who barely knows him but will put up with anything. The majority of the chapters consist of him abusing her emotionally and then making it all better through make up sex. It does not even follow a story line: it's chapter after chapter of the same thing.<br /><br />No. Just no. Absolutely no meaning. Absolutely no depth. Absolutely no character development. Absolutely no plot development. Absolutely nothing.<br /><br />Perhaps after its publishing it will get better. Maybe, just maybe, I'll actually bother to finish the trilogy. I would never buy this, but I would be willing to finish it on Wattpad -- although I suspect it will not get edited the\u0440\u0435. So that's an unlikely scenario.<br /><br />But until I see a more decent version, I'll be stuck here wondering how many of the people who made this story so popular are over 13 years of age.<br /><br />(And mind you, I'd consider After 18+.)<br /><br />Sorry for being harsh. But this story does not even deserve one star in my eyes.<br />",

    "text": "You can go ahead and judge me for reading this, it\u2019s okay really, I\u2019m already judging myself for it. When I first heard of/picked up <i>After </i>and saw that it was originally 1direction fan-fiction I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever laughed so hard in my life. Then I kept seeing people post pictures and reviews on it all talking about how they are now hooked on this series. It physically hurts me to say this, but I\u2019m hooked too. <i>After </i>is the epitome of what most would call \u201c<i>a guilty pleasure read</i>\u201d. <br><br><b>I have never, ever hated two characters more than I hate Tessa and Hardin.</b><br><br><b>Tessa </b>is: Whiny, stuck up, annoying, childish, pathetic, a H2ho, immature, irresponsible, vapid, shallow, and an overall turd. Tessa spends 90% of this book crying and the other 10% of the time coming up with reasons to cry again.<br><br><b>Hardin </b>is: cocky, annoying, bizarre, stage five clinger, gross, immature, actually a woman, hot tempered, mental, and zero dark crazy. I have no doubt in my mind that Hardin is the girl in this relationship. Trust me when I say he is more pathetic than Tessa is.<br><br>That is just the tip of the iceberg on the things I loathe about these two. The relationship between the two is not only unhealthy but just <br>downright awful. It\u2019s unbalanced and almost always one sided. Their relationship is the furthest thing from romantic. Not only did I hate them when they were separate but I hated them more when they were <br>together. Their relationship is way out in the deep end of the crazy pool and it was so bad I wanted to drown just trying to endure it.<br><br>As far as the plot goes, there\u2019s not much of one. It\u2019s just 600 pages of a rinse and repeat story line. Hardin acts like a dick, ask Tessa for one more chance, Tessa says okay, they make up for a day, and then the cycle starts all over again. No seriously, that\u2019s the whole story, nothing else to it. Personally, I will say that I think people are a <br>little harsh on Todd\u2019s writing. Yes, it\u2019s not the best, but I\u2019ve definitely seen worse. It\u2019s just light writing. You\u2019re never going to <br>have to Google something that is said, or have to set the book aside <br>because it gets to deep, but it\u2019s not the worst of the worst.<br><br><i>After </i>lacks any and all originality, depth, and personality. But, you want to know what the worst part is? The downright dirty worst part?!.. Is that I couldn\u2019t put this book down. It was like watching a car crash in slow motion. I wanted to look away but just couldn\u2019t! And just when I think I\u2019ll finally be able to shake the madness of this book off Anna Todd hit me hard with a WTF ending, that I didn\u2019t see coming.<br><br><div>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8SMT9q3gTxg/VV5Yr2I5BfI/AAAAAAAABsU/tANVT1YiITM/s1600/wth.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n    <img height=\"131\" src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1432246474ra/14912107.gif\" width=\"320\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n</div><br><br>I hate admitting that even though I hated everything about this book, there was just something about it that kept me coming back for more.",

    "text": "<i>Before you read this, please remember that this is my own personal opinion and that, with this very negative review, I'm by no means bashing those who liked this book or related to its characters.</i><br><br><a href=\"https://gifyu.com/image/SzKMZ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1644074881i/32536016._SX540_.jpg\" alt=\"last-banner822065b4a2007932.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a><br><br>That being said, I think this is the first time in my reading experience where I wish I could rate a book -5 stars. Why? Because After is the most horrible thing I've ever read in my life.<br>It praises moral/verbal abuse and very unhealty relationships. Not to mention the slut-shaming and the way it speaks to good girls as if being naive and inexperienced is something they need to fix right away. Sorry to bother you, Anna Todd, but 1940 called to say it wants its mysogyny back when you're done using it. <br><br>I mean, I've read bad books before, and I sometimes found myself even liking them or what you may call problematic characters, anyway, but this? This is not problematic, this not even slightly twisted. <br>This is a straight up mess that was most certainly created for the sole erotic purpose and the \"plot\" that was attached to it for the sake of calling it a book and not fan-fiction, is just funfetti. <br><br>(speaking of fan-fiction; I thought it was a running joke I didn't understand but it turns out this REALLY is a freaking wattpad monster. And it was based on no other than the cutiepie that is Harry Styles?? I'd sue if I were him, no joking intended.)<br><br>The main character is one of the most unrelatable, annoying, judgy girls I've ever encountered in books (say hi, Lara Jean), and Hardin, her male counterpart, should really consider therapy or else self-employ himself in a circus because he's nothing but a rabied bear. <br>If he doesn't, please someone come collect him and lock him away where he can't harm anyone anymore. He's so scary, moody and crazy I was afraid he'd jump out the pages and scold me for reading. <br><br>Imagine what a happy relationship these two must have. <br><br>Of course, there's the sex - another meh to add to the collection - that should patch all this up, but not even all the positions of Kamasutra could save these two and their madness. Hardin makes Christian Grey look like a maltese teacup and Tessa should move stares, buy a vibrator if it's the sex she needs to function, or simply learn to love herself. <br><br>Also, the stereotypes killed me. In this book people are evilized or seen as the bad guys because they have tattoos and piercings, dye their hair, have casual sex and wear tight clothes. Should I tell 9o% of people I know they're walking disasters or should I recommend them this book so they can find out themselves? <br><br>Character development? Redemption? You won't find them here or in any other book of the series. <br>This story left me so uncomfortable and shaken that I had to finish a whole jar of pickles to get over it.<br>Again, if you liked it, I'm happy for you, but I will never understand how this is considered 'a masterpiece', or where it got all its success. Sometimes, fanfictions should stay fanfictions. <br>I wish I could unread it or at least forget stories as toxic as this one are being published and praised for their portrayal of romance like it's nothing, while real works of art get rejected every day.<br><br>Honestly, just slap a <i>dark romance</i> tag on this, already, and let readers know it's full of shit you can romanticize all you want as long as you recognize it's questionable in terms of morality.<br><br><br>edit Oct. 10 2019<br>I just watched the movie because it was on and I had no idea I was watching it until names were made. I kept watching it because I wanted to see if maybe it suffered from the Twilight Effect which imo made the movies more tolerable than the books (I'm still crying over that long khaki skirt) buuuuut nope. Movie adaptation not doing it for me, either.<br>I must admit that it was slightly less cringy than the books, tho, but only a bit. Those longing looks, the Truth or Dare, the peer pressure, the slut/purity-shaming and fighting were more than enough to last for weeks. <br>The actors were good and extremely pretty, so I'm giving the movie an additional quarter of a star for this! <br>And, why not, I'm also giving myself 10 gold star for the effort of not throwing my remote to the TV.<br><br><br><br>\ud83d\udea9\ud835\ude7f\ud835\ude7e\ud835\ude82\ud835\ude82\ud835\ude78\ud835\ude71\ud835\ude7b\ud835\ude74

This book honestly infuriated me even more than <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3693130162\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ignite Me</a> did, and that's saying something. However, unlike 'Ignite Me', 'After' also had exactly three somewhat redeemable points.<br><br>(That's not saying much, because the entire book is a sea of 'nope', with about three droplets of 'not-as-shitty-as-the-rest-of-it'.)<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1612995551ra/30845139.gif\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><i>Real footage of my braincells dropping dead because of this dumpster fire.</i><br><br>'After' tries to tell the story of Tessa Young, a perfect little college student whose life is turned absolutely upside down after meeting <s>bad boy Harry Styles</s> Hardin Scott, because of a relationship that is as long as it is fun to read about. So that is to say, not <s>fun</s> long at all.<br><br>Tessa is your classic good girl. All she does is study and never has any fun. She just wants to be successful in life and not get in trouble, and is therefore not like other teenagers, let alone other girls. Logic 100. Additionally, because of her financial situation, despite her AmAzInG gRaDeS she only applies to one school. Not even ONE safety school. Logic 1000.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1613467912i/30874537.jpg\" width=\"350\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>As you can see, Tessa is the smartest person on the planet, ever. When she meets Hardin, things aren't exactly off to a great start for this pErFeCt CoUpLe. She goes as far as to acknowledge that she's judging him for his tattoos and piercings, but turns right around and says that she's being polite. She claIMS THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS. SHE INSINUATES THAT PEOPLE WITH OCD ARE CRAZY.<br><br>*visibly attempts to remain sane*<br><br>She hates Steph, her roommate, on-site because she wears revealing clothes and has tattoos/piercings. (I actually somewhat liked Steph because she defends Tessa and remains supportive of her even when Tessa is so outright judgemental about her, even if Steph peer-pressures Tessa somewhat.) This brings us to one of the biggest problems with this book: <b>all the slut-shaming.</b><br><br>You see, Tessa holds herself in such high regard because of how 'perfect' and 'innocent' she is. She hates everyone who \"looks different\", especially girls who dress differently from how she does. It gets particularly worse when a side character, Molly, is introduced.<br><br>Girl-on-girl hate reaches its peak in this book, because Molly exists solely to make Tessa jealous, and she goes as far as to call Molly a 'skank' and a 'whore' multiple times. Just because Molly used to sleep with Hardin. <s>Which Tessa now does.</s><br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1613470027ra/30874679.gif\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>((Call-out paragraph for Tessa's mother, who takes one look at the band posters, piercings, and <s>pentagrams</s> black leather, and demands that Tessa change dorms, and occasionally shows up from time to time. No joke. Tessa's mother is more of a Karen than the character named 'Karen' in this book.))<br><br>Tessa goes to a party with some other people and drinks for the first time. She stumbles into a bedroom with books in it. Because Tessa is the most intelligent of all intellectuals, her favorite book is 'Wuthering Heights', which she notices with the books. Just as she sits down to read it, Hardin walks into the room. We learn that not only is Hardin a bad boy, but an intellectual because he reads \u2728classics\u2728.<br><br>There is instant kemistree between the two of them, and we know this because we get more descriptions of Hardin's eyes than what goes on at school. In one of the few chapters that we do get to see what goes on at school, Tessa befriends Landon, who turns out to be Hardin's step-brother, but is one of the only characters I actually liked because of how genuinely nice he is.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1613470597ra/30874784.gif\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Apart from all of that, Tessa has actually had a boyfriend this entire time - Noah. Noah is also nice but basically has no role in the story other than to build part of Tessa's love triangle. He's worried about Tessa and calls her mother on a few occasions, on account of how Tessa seems unable to make good decisions anymore.<br><br>Time passes, drunken games of truth-or-dare are played, and Hardin and Tessa decide to try to be friends. They decide to go out one day...<br><br>...and Hardin fingers her at a lake.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1613471070ra/30874819.gif\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Tessa comes to the conclusion that she doesn't want to be with Noah, but actually Hardin. Of course, for how smart she is, Tessa can't figure out how to break up with him, bEcAuSe ThEy'Ve BeEn BeSt FrIeNdS fOrEvEr. So, basically, it's okay to cheat on your boyfriend if you \u2728feel bad\u2728 about it. She repeatedly acknowledges that cheating is wrong but continues to do it because she's nOt LiKe OtHeR gIrLs.<br><br>The level of drama in this book genuinely rivals that of a soap opera. Noah finds out that Tessa has been cheating on him with Hardin in the most dramatic way possible, but decides that he can put it behind them if Tessa stops seeing Hardin. So she does.<br><br>Kidding! Of course not! Tessa and Hardin get caught by Landon of all people and continue messing around with each other. Poor Noah finds out about them <i>again</i> and they properly break up.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1613510528ra/30878993.gif\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>And so begins a disturbing montage of push-and-pull between Tessa and Hardin, as they decide to properly date. Except not really. Hardin starts oPeNiNg Up to Tessa, and shows her a SoFtEr SiDe of him, which convinces her that he really does like her, but just feels conflicted sometimes. <br><br>So when the two of them argue (which is almost constantly), instead of standing up for herself, Tessa thinks that it's better for her to just be quiet and let him work through it. Hardin will yell at her, and then thirty seconds later we're getting ghastly descriptions of him going down on her. All while being told how rOmAnTiC he is.<br><br>This brings us to the biggest problem of the book: <b>the relationship itself.</b> Tessa and Hardin's relationship is emotionally and at times physically abusive. Hardin manipulates Tessa to the point where she thinks that their relationship is normal. Hardin is actually so terrible that everytime he acts even remotely decent, he is lauded for how incredible he is.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1613961774ra/30905623.gif\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br><s>He also constantly called Tessa 'bAbY', which absolutely grated on my nerves. If I ever have to hear that word again, I am going to \u2728yeet myself into a void\u2728 and die a traumatized human.</s><br><br>Hardin is terrible to everyone, a behavior which seems to stem from the fact that his father was a neglectful alcoholic at one point. And so because of that, Hardin is still incredibly disrespectful to his father, his step-mother, his step-brother, and the world at large.<br><br>There's one scene in particular that comes to my mind. Tessa is screaming about how miserable she is when she's with Hardin, and how being with him was terrible for her. She acknowledges that his behavior is borderline sociopathic, and tells him that he brings out the worst in her.<br><br>His response? That even though he brings out the worst in her, she brings out the best in him, so it's good for them to stay together.<br><br>Yeah. uMM-<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1602608106ra/30233295.gif\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><i>AKA Hardin in a gif.</i><br><br>To make matters worse, they move in together. Tessa's mother shows up, and drama ensues.<br><br>However I'd like to point out one VERY big problem with this: Tessa doesn't <i>really</i> know Hardin. She met him, what, 6 months ago, when she started college? She doesn't even know his favorite color, let alone who he truly is. He could be an axe-murderer for all she knows, luring her into a false sense of security, getting her to trust him completely and abandon all of her friends only to betray her in the worst way at the end.<br><br><s>Oh wait.</s><br><br>Tessa also gets an internship at Vance Publishing, where she gets her own office and basically reads manuscripts all day. I'd like to point out that Tessa is a COLLEGE. STUDENT. If she spends all day at her internship, and all night fucking Hardin, where the hell does she find the time to go to classes? Does she even go to classes?? What about hOMEWORK???<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1613963472ra/30905728.gif\" width=\"350\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>One day, Hardin stays out all night and refuses to tell Tessa where he had been. It's clear to her that he has been drinking, even though he had initially claimed to almost never drink <s>although he spends a good portion of this book drunk, but we're not going to start questioning that now</s>.<br><br>Tessa decides that she's going to be strict with him, and tells him that she isn't going to sleep with him that night, or something. He tells her something along the lines of \"bUt YoU kNoW i GeT nIgHtMaReS wHeN i DoN't SlEeP wItH yOu\" (which, hey, again, manipulation!), and explains why: when he was really young, he saw his mother raped in front of him, and has had nightmares ever since.<br><br>I know, that's a terrible thing to happen to someone, especially at a young age. But what does giving Hardin a tragic backstory do, other than \"excuse\" him for his disgusting behavior? Absolutely nothing. Trying to garner sympathy because you witnessed something that horrible is not okay. It does not, in any way, shape, or form give you special permission to treat everyone like dirt.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1613463696ra/30874322.gif\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Things actually seem to get better between Tessa and Hardin, to the point where he acts like a decent human being at his father's wedding. Of course, they have sex. However, things aren't adding up, and Tessa decides to go meet Steph (who, surprise surprise, is still alive!) and the rest of their friends.<br><br>When she gets to the restaurant where they're all meeting, she finds Hardin with Molly and immediately sees red. She demands an explanation from everyone there and finds out that her relationship with Hardin thus far has been a farce. It was all a bet to find out who could take Tessa's virginity first.<br><br><i>Definitely</i> didn't see that coming.<br><br>Tessa leaves the restaurant in a heartbroken fury, all whilst Hardin attempts to console her, and claims that he had never meant to hurt her, and all sorts of irritating drivel. <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1613519026i/30879539._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><i>Tessa and Hardin's relationship right now. Probably. Hopefully.</i><br><br>And so this dreadful dumpster fire goes out. Except not really, because there are four more books. I'd like to think that Tessa really means it, splits with Hardin for real, and gets her life back on track, but something tells me not to be optimistic.<br><br>All of that being said, if you think about it, there's really no plot whatsoever. It's just a couple of college kids being horny and making bad decisions. <br><br>We're not even going to talk about character development, because it's nonexistent. <br><br>The writing was simultaneously slow and rushed, and ultimately very painful to read.<br><br>The narrator was... oh god. Let's not even talk about this. The narrator must have been desperate to go through with all of this, but their voice only made it worse for me.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1476596257ra/20860112.gif\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><i>That's actually a lie. I managed to make my way through this book, didn't I?</i><br><br>There's just one last thing I'd like to address: <b>the 60,000 five-star ratings</b>. To everyone who gave this book that high a rating, I'd just like to know one thing: <i>why???</i> There's literally no redeemable aspect of this book. It isn't even remotely fun. The smut is dry and stale. Hardin's relationship with Tessa is disturbing and abusive. Harding isn't even hot!<br><br>Essentially this book accomplishes two things:<br><br>1.) Embodies every terrible trope that is characteristic of Wattpad fanfiction, and<br><br>2.) Tells readers that the sort of relationship Tessa and Hardin have is okay. That it's perfectly fine, good even, to be emotionally abused the way Tessa is in the book if he's \"hot\" and has a tragic past. (If I'm being completely honest, however, it is difficult for me to even show any sympathy for Tessa because of how awful and hypocritical she is.)<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1613967079ra/30905841.gif\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><i>Live footage of me yeeting all my memories of this book.</i><br><br>So yeah.

    "text": "First of all I just want to say that I was 100% ready to hate this book with a passion. I\u2019m not a fan of Harry Styles or One Direction (haha this has since changed), but I honestly just wanted to read it so that I could form my own opinion of it and let you guys know how I felt about it.<br /><br />I want to start off by saying that this was a Harry Styles fanfiction on wattpad that received so many views that it got published. Anna Todd has never written anything else and it\u2019s a fanfiction, so I had to take that on board when I started reading it, but I was genuinely surprised. <br /><br />I understand where people are coming from when they say that Tessa and Hardin\u2019s relationship is abusive. But I watched an interview with the author and I thought it was so interesting. She straight up said that he\u2019s a bad person and that not all people are good. This story is realistic in that sense. Everyone has issues and he\u2019s obviously trying to deal with those, but it\u2019s obvious to anyone who reads this book that he\u2019s trying so hard to change. When this is all he\u2019s ever known, how can he just all of a sudden forget all of his past issues and be a good person? That\u2019s just not realistic. That\u2019s what I liked about After, that it depicted something that wasn\u2019t necessarily good or healthy, but it was real. <br /><br />I think I may have hated this book if Tessa just took the abuse and kept crawling back to him, but she doesn\u2019t. She sticks up for herself and is a feisty, independent character who knows what she wants, and she will tell him if he needs to get back in line and I really, really appreciated this. I don\u2019t think this book is glamorising abusive relationships. I think it\u2019s teaching people empathy, that not all people are perfect and how to stick up for yourself \u2013 not only did she stick up for herself to Hardin, but also to her mother.<br /><br />Going into this, I thought it would be all about the romance, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s got so many other aspects in it that revolve around family, friends, university and work life. This isn\u2019t just a love story, it\u2019s a coming of age story. Tessa really grows as a person and realises what she wants in life and I admire that. <br /><br />Obviously this wasn\u2019t going to be the most beautifully written book out there, but it sure was addicting and I raced through the almost 600 pages in less than 3 days. I grew to really care for these characters and want the best for them. <br /><br />Just know that I understand where the haters are coming from, but Hardin is changing for the better and is trying so hard to be good for Tessa and Tessa is a badass who can hold her own and is trying to help Hardin get over his past and become a better person. And that\u2019s what matters, that he\u2019s trying and that she has the compassion to help him. <br /><br />I am so surprised that I didn\u2019t turn out to be one of the people hating on this book, and I\u2019m so glad I gave it a chance. Don\u2019t be embarrassed to read this book because of all of the hate it\u2019s receiving. I say to give it a go and form your own opinion and I ask you not to judge it based on the fact that it\u2019s a fanfiction. <br /><br />I don\u2019t recommend this book for younger readers as there is explicit sex, swearing, drug and alcohol references and is just generally not for younger readers. <br /><br />",

    "text": "I read After when it was 'The Book' on wattpad a few years back and I'm embarrassed to admit that I read all the 3 books in the series (the original one before Ms.Todd decided to milk this for all it's worth and came up with more unnecessary drama in an already fucked up relationship). In my defense, I wanted to see if the girl would grow some balls and dump Harry's sorry ass, which does happen time and again, till Harry strips and Tessa falls head over heels in lust. Needless to say I was repulsed.<br /><br />The girl in me hated the character Harry/Hardin. But the reader in me was furious with the way the author romanticised every red flag and abuse. <br /><br />Still I suffered 300 chapters in the hope of redemption or closure or anything to make me believe I hadn't wasted time on these books, but it was a hopeless cause. So being the mature person that I am (erm, sometimes), I tried to forget I ever read such a shitty piece of literature and moved on.<br /><br />I wouldn't have wasted more time on writing this review if it weren't for a friend of mine who said she wanted a boyfriend like Harry/Hardin. I was stumped and gave her a 30 minute lecture, which ended with me being called a grandma.(!!)<br /><br />Not to sound so preachy but if anyone's reading this, please come out of your After ever happy bubble and smell the fucking coffee. Try to understand that what Hardin and Tessa had was not love. Or the kind of relationship you would want to be in. It was a disproportionate mess of lies, games, manipulation, emotional abuse, unhealthy attachments, unresolved mental issues and lots of sex. <br />And I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that this book is a bestseller (and now, a movie deal?!) <br />Just what the heck is wrong with everyone???",

But sometimes you just have to quit because it just doesn't work out for you. And you can no longer fool yourself and hope that things will get better as the story goes.<br><br>So yeah.. I DNF-ed this book for these reasons:<br><br>1. <b>Writing Style</b> - This book is poorly written and executed. I see so much potentials in this book but it fails to hold my attention most of the time because of the boring writing.<br><br>2. <b>Plot</b> - You can never find an absolute plot in this book.

Why pretend and fool yourself? Tessa and Hardin are both immature characters. They always bicker like children and wow, their childish behavior annoys the crap out of me! And don't even get me started on Hardin's attitude! Gaaah this guy makes me want to pull my hair out because he's simply such a prick! <br><br>4. <b>Cheating</b> - Just so we're clear, I despise books with cheating, but I admit that there are books that I loved even when there's cheating involved but that's because they're simply well-written and well-justified. But this? A girl cheats on her boyfriend just because her boyfriend is boring and omg there's a tattooed and pierced boy-next-door who's way hotter and exciting than him. What the actual f*ck? And damn Hardin. This guy! He knows the girl has a boyfriend and yet he continues to seduce her just so he can prove that he's a sex god!<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1453091776ra/17779860.gif\" width=\"350\" height=\"230\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1453091776ra/17779861.gif\" width=\"320\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>I did try to like this book, honestly.

I\u2019ve seen some people say that this book is like a drug, and I actually agree with them. You know why? BECAUSE IT\u2019S BAD. Didn\u2019t we all learn this in elementary school? Don\u2019t do drugs, kids. I mean that literally and figuratively. If someone ever compares a book to drugs, run far, far away. This isn\u2019t addictive or even a \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d. Hardin is also compared to a drug in this book if that tells you anything. No. Just no. I have lost all hope for humanity if this is what we\u2019ve come to. <br><br>I rarely hate books, and when I do, there\u2019s usually at least one thing I like about it. Not with this book. I actually hate everything about it. Of course, opinions on books are subjective, but I can not think of one reason someone would like that book. Just thinking about it makes me rage.

It shouldn\u2019t be romanticized. If you are experiencing something similar to Tessa and Hardin\u2019s relationship, please call the domestic violence hotline. Stay safe and please get help if needed. <br><br>This book follows Tessa as she goes into her first year of college. She\u2019s not like other girls, she\u2019s a good girl. All she does is study and she never has fun. So not other girl-like. She wants to be successful in life and she never gets in trouble, making her not like other girls. She\u2019s a virgin, unlike those other girls, or as she would say \u201cthose other sluts\u201d. And guess what? She reads! Classic literature! *gasp* Did I mention she\u2019s not like other girls?<br><br>Then she meets Hardin. And surprise surprise, he\u2019s a bAd BoY. What else did you expect? He has a lip ring, which we are reminded of constantly. Hardin is also not like other boys. He\u2019s British. He has tousled hair. He has dark, but somehow soft eyes. And he\u2019s very hot, which we are also constantly reminded of because apparently being \u201chot\u201d makes up for the abuse and literal rape. He also reads classic literature, therefore very smart and a good person. Definitely. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1545852448ra/26813237.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br> After Tessa\u2019s first interaction with him, she automatically decides that he is extremely rude. He is rude. But of course, Tessa is drawn to him. Even though she shouldn\u2019t be. She has a boyfriend. A good, reliable, kind one. He\u2019s actually one of the only decent characters in the book. So why would she want anything to do with him? We\u2019re all asking the same question. <br><br>Surprise surprise, they end up getting together. While Tessa is still with Noah and Hardin is still messing around with literally every girl in the school. End me now. <br><br>Tessa and Hardin\u2019s relationship is terrible, horrible, no good, very bad, I could go on. All they do is fight -&gt; have sex -&gt; say they love each other -&gt; fight, and then the cycle repeats. FOR ALMOST 600 PAGES. It\u2019s emotionally and physically abusive. Tessa herself realizes this. But does she still go back to him every time? Of course. She just can\u2019t stop herself because when she looks into his eyes-- I\u2019m going to stop. Hardin is so awful that whenever he\u2019s nice to her (which is only after they do the deed, obviously) he is praised and Tessa says stuff about how she wishes he could always be nice. The thing that got me most is when he was nice Tessa knew he was just going to be mean soon enough. SHE LITERALLY SAID IT. So why doesn\u2019t she cut all ties with him? SHE\u2019S AN IDIOT IS THE ONLY ANSWER. I don\u2019t even feel bad for her because she\u2019s not even making an effort and she\u2019s extremely hypocritical. <br><br>Sorry, I\u2019m angry just thinking about it. Deep breaths. <br><br>Hardin is extremely overprotective of Tessa. And not in a good way. Apparently it\u2019s okay for him to go with other girls every time Tessa doesn\u2019t do exactly what he wants but if Tessa so much as waves to another guy all hell breaks loose. You don\u2019t even care about her anyways, why does it matter so much to you?<br><br>Who thought this was a good idea? This is Wattpad fanfiction. Not even good Wattpad fanfiction. And you can tell. You write every single stereotype and overused trope but make them 10000x worse, add lots of problematic things, and you have After. I would sincerely apologize to Harry Styles (who this is a fanfic of), but he already has the author blocked on Twitter. Rightfully so. I\u2019m sure the actual Harry is a kind person, but I will never view him the same. This is creepy fan behavior. <br><br>The writing is truly the quality of a Wattpad fanfic, as expected. It just deteriorates throughout the book and slowly descends into negative levels of quality. All of it is more funny when you imagine Hardin\u2019s \u201cmad\u201d lines in a British accent. I was wheezing, and to be honest, that was the only thing getting me through this book. I don\u2019t think this was edited before it was published. Or even read over, because this is so problematic I don\u2019t know how any publisher could publish this. It gives me hope that maybe my book can actually get published. <br><br>The characters are all awful. I hate everyone. Except maybe Landon, Noah, and Steph. Those are also the only characters who have a bit of sense.<br><br> <img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1615824879ra/31017036.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>I feel bad for them because they have to deal with everyone\u2019s idiocy. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1615824879ra/31017037.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>The girl-on-girl hate and slut-shaming in here are off the charts. Tessa is extremely judgemental of Steph, her roommate, just because she has piercings, tattoos, and doesn\u2019t dress modestly. Steph puts up with her through all of this and defends her even in spite of all of this. Molly, a side character who only exists to make Tessa jealous and Hardin to cheat on Tessa with, gets called a \u201cskank\u201d and \u201cwhore\u201d by Tessa multiple times just because she has slept with Hardin before. <s>Who\u2019s going to tell Tessa she sleeps with him later</s><br><br>Anyways. Moving on. <br><br>One line of many that were extremely problematic:<br><blockquote>\n  <i>I grab my books and lay them out neatly, in order of my class schedule, and stack the notes for each class on top of them.<br>\u201cAre you OCD or something?\u201d<br>\u201cNo, Hardin. Not everyone\u2019s crazy because they just like things a certain way.\u201d</i>\n</blockquote><br><br>As someone with diagnosed OCD, this is extremely offensive. <br><br>1. That\u2019s not even what OCD is. OCD is not wanting everything to be perfect.<br>2. You aren\u2019t OCD, you have OCD. <br>3. People with OCD are not crazy. You are if you think this is okay. <br><br>I could go more into this, but I\u2019m mad enough already.<br><br>Another:<br><br><blockquote>\n  <i>Everyone seems to be comfortable with half-naked bodies of both genders walking around; college life is strange so far, and it\u2019s only the second day.</i>\n</blockquote><br><br>In case you didn\u2019t know, there are more than two genders. Idiots. *rage* Wondering how Tessa got into college with an IQ in the negatives. (Which also happened to be the only school she applied to, further proving how dumb she is. Seriously. She didn\u2019t even apply to one safety school.)<br><br>That brings us to.. the smut. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1615677906ra/31008728.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><i>Real footage of my drowning myself in holy water after reading this. </i><br><br>Before reading this, I was reading reviews and I saw <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2778456583?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this one.</a><br><br>I thought it was joking. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1615824879ra/31017038.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>THIS WAS AN ACTUAL SCENE IN THE BOOK.

But apparently it\u2019s okay because she felt bad. She acknowledges that cheating is not okay, but continues to do it. It\u2019s fine though!! She\u2019s not like other girls so she can do that!!! She didn\u2019t even break up with him but just had to be with Hardin because they were meant to be together apparently. <br><br>Ahahahahaha. No.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1606559858ra/30439295.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Noah finds out that Tessa is cheating on him in the most dramatic way ever, and this poor kid (bless his soul for tolerating Tessa) decides that they can still be together if Tessa never interacts with Hardin again.<br><br>Do you really think Tessa\u2019s going to follow that?<br><br>Spoiler: She doesn\u2019t. <br><br>Noah finds out yet again after Hardin and Tessa are caught by Hardin\u2019s stepbrother (also one of the only decent characters) Landon. Then they finally break up. <br><br>While all this drama is happening, apparently Tessa is going to school and has a job?? But we see none of that?? Tessa and Hardin are too busy having sex and fighting?? I am done with this. <br><br>The reason Tessa and Hardin stay together is that he brings out the worst in her, but she brings out the best in him. Which is apparently a good reason for them to be together. Right. Because that\u2019s totally not bad at all. Even though Hardin has been through terrible things, that doesn\u2019t excuse any of his behavior. Being traumatized isn\u2019t a free pass for you to go traumatize other people. The whole theme of this book that all Hardin needed to become a good person was a good girl is extremely problematic and wrong. It didn\u2019t even work, because all they did was scream at each and have sex and guess what? Hardin\u2019s still an asshole. He is a perfect example of why many women are scared of men. <br><br>The plot twist was just so shocking! Who would have known Hardin was just using Tessa to win a bet!! I can\u2019t believe it.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1615824879ra/31017039.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>It was revealed in the most dramatic way and of course Tessa is hEaRtBrOkEn.

He's nearing retirement (think \"bald and fat and old,\" not sexy guy) and is showing his new assistant, Ed Witwer, around the office. They visit the area where the three precogs - described as gibbering idiots, deformed and retarded monkeys (yes, you can certainly tell this was written in the 50s) - are kept who visualize every future crime. The dreams are captured by machines and printed on punchcards. :D If your name shows up on a card as a future murderer, you're arrested and held in a detention camp indefinitely.<br /><br />When Anderson picks up a card and sees his name on it as the future murderer of Leopold Kaplan - a man he doesn't even know - in one week, he suspects his wife and/or Witwer of setting him up. He pockets the card but, knowing that army headquarters receives a duplicate printout, he immediately takes off, determined to prove his innocence. He's abducted promptly upon leaving his house and taken to the home of a retired Army general: Leonard Kaplan himself, who has some things to discuss with Anderton.<br /><br />The story and the movie start in very similar places but then turn down different tracks, and by the end they've veered wildly apart. It's interesting to compare the two and their different takes on the ethics of the Precrime system and whether it should go or stay as part of society. The story is admittedly quite dated but I found the twists and turns, and the key of the minority report, fascinating.",

    "text": "<b><i>The Minority Report</i> Twenty Years On</b><br /><br />John Anderton is a police commissioner involved in a pioneering project called Precrime. Through information provided by suitably trained individuals called Precogs (short for Pre-Cognitives), the agency is able to identify crimes that are going to happen in the future and prevent them by arresting the perpetrator and placing him/her in a detention facility. The results of this experimental policy have been extraordinary. In the space of just a few years, violent crime has all but disappeared in New York. We enter the story when a new commissioner assistant, Ed Witwer, reports at Anderton's office, looking to be filled in on the project and not being exactly secretive about his long-term ambition to replace Anderton as commissioner one day. Needless to say, Anderton is not enamoured with his new assistant.<br /><br />Shortly afterwards, Anderton receives a card from the precogs stating that he will be the perpetrator of a crime in just a few days\u2019 time. The person he is going to kill, a Mr. Leopold Kaplan, is quite unknown to him. Anderton is aghast. Not only is his future on the line - having received notification by the precogs that a crime is going to happen the police have no option but detain him - but the reputation of the agency is also at stake. Anderton does not know Kaplan at all; why should he want to kill him? He suspects a conspiracy to get him out of the way as a police commissioner, possibly to make way for his shiny new assistant, Witwer. He tries to escape. But how to disappear in a city that is tightly controlled and all movements monitored?<br /><br />Though heavily tracked by police who have now turned against one of their own, Anderton is able to escape for now. At this point, he becomes aware of a peculiarity in the precog system, which is that quite often not all three precogs engaged by the agency give exactly the same information about the future. It sometimes happens that one of the precogs gives slightly different information from the other two, which leads to what is called a \u2018minority report\u2019. Usually, the minority report does not differ wildly from the other two, but it does open the possibility of a flaw in the system because if punishment is based on the evidence of the precogs, how can it be justified if that evidence is shaky? It could be that the system has been flawed all along, and what will happen to Precrime then?<br /><br />Anderton's main worry at this point is to find out what happened to his own minority report because first of all he needs to clear his name. He needs to go back to Precrime offices and try to discover whether perchance the prediction that he is going to kill Kaplan is a majority report, and if so, what happened to the minority report. Obviously, Anderton wants the minority report to say that he is innocent, but if that were to happen, Precrime, his life\u2019s work, would prove itself to be unreliable. What to do? <br /><br />Without going to go into any detail about what happens next (for the benefit of readers who have not read/watched this yet), I'm now going to explain what makes this a very special story for me.<br /><br />This is familiar P.K. Dick territory: the story is quite cerebral with an emphasis on the logical paradoxes that emerge when we attempt to look into the future. There are some magnificent passages towards the beginning when Anderton explains to Witwer the way the system works. <br /><br /><i>\u201cYou\u2019ve probably already grasped the basic legalistic drawback to precrime methodology. We\u2019re taking in individuals who have broken no law.\u201d<br />\u201cBut surely, they will,\u201d Witwer affirmed with conviction.<br />\u201cHappily, they don\u2019t \u2014 because we get to them first, before they can commit an act of violence. So the commission of the crime itself is absolute metaphysics. We can claim they are culpable. They, on the other hand, can eternally claim they\u2019re innocent. And, in a sense, they are innocent.\u201d</i><br /><br />There are many arresting ideas in this short passage. Without a doubt, the word \u2018metaphysics\u2019 will strike readers as quite central. What was originally meant by \u2018metaphysics\u2019 is that which is beyond physics, beyond the real world. For example, reference to suprasensible realities (Plato\u2019s forms, for instance, or God) is metaphysical because these realities cannot be made available to the senses and are therefore spurious. Dick reverses the normal meaning of metaphysics; the crime no longer belongs to the realm of the sensible world. Instead what belongs to that world is the previsions that a certain crime will be committed. <br /><br />A consequence of this is that a culpable individual is not someone who has committed a crime. Technically, all those detained by Precrime are innocent. And yet, the system <i>works</i>. There is no crime in New York city. Note the play between the future tense that Witwer uses in the above passage (\u201cBut, surely, they will\u201d) and the present tense that Anderton uses (\u201cHappily, they don\u2019t\u201d). What Dick is suggesting here is that the reason why crimes are not committed any more is not because our look into the future is infallible but because people refrain from committing them in the knowledge that they will be caught. In other words, the consequences of an action are so immediate (arrest even before the act is committed) that nobody risks crime any more. In the film this is portrayed poignantly by having Tom Cruise\u2019s character say that no premeditated crimes are committed any more, only crimes of passion because people commit these on the spur of the moment overwhelmed by their emotions.<br /><br />And then P.K. Dick brings in another big idea. No, not the idea of free will although that is undoubtedly there (especially in the film). Dick\u2019s big idea is to make the future a plaything at the hands of the various state agencies that vie for power. In the book the Army wants to humiliate the police and especially Precrime because they see it as an impediment to their own dominance. So they set Anderton up: if Anderton kills Kaplan (which he may well want to do given that Kaplan is an enemy of Precrime), he confirms his enemies who are intent on proving that the Pre-cogs\u2019 previsions are unreliable. But if he does not kill Kaplan, he also proves Kaplan right because it shows that majority reports are not to be trusted!<br /><br />And here is where the story\u2019s cerebral character gives way to a more nuanced consideration of the stakes involved. The future is not predetermined, and Anderton, too, can play with the various options the future affords him even if the personal cost to prove Kaplan wrong is quite high. He does not hesitate. In a very suspenseful sequence of events, Anderton decides that it\u2019s the bigger picture that matters. Like a true Dickian hero \u2013 flawed, unlikeable, battered by life\u2019s whims \u2013 Anderton still manages to salvage the reputation of his life\u2019s work for which he has worked so hard.<br /><br />There are considerable differences between the film and Dick\u2019s story even though the basic premise is the same and even some phrases from the book are used verbatim in the screenplay. Not being a huge fan of Tom Cruise I cannot say that I enjoyed the film as much as I enjoyed the story. I think that Cruise lacks the depth of a Harrison Ford (Blade Runner) just as Spielberg lacks the depth of a Ridley Scott. Overall, though, not a bad film with some memorable acting (e.g. by Samantha Morton as the Precog Agatha).",

Let's just say I've never liked him and have only tolerated watching his movies, all the while wishing it was someone else in his role. <br><br>Even with my anti-Cruise bias, I really enjoyed the heck out of the movie and expected the same with the story. Well, that didn't happen. Oh, I enjoyed it all right. It's perfectly fine. However, it lacks tension. Certainly high-stakes are on the line for our hero Anderton, the head of police force that captures and incarcerates would-be criminals before the crime is committed, but figuring out what's going on is made all too easy for him. It needed to be teased out a bit more. <br><br>I have to hand it to the screenwriters and director Steven Spielberg for tricking out this pedestrian story and turning it into a fast, fun, 2+ hour thrill ride. In comparison, the original story is like a quarter's worth of floppy anti-climax on one of those sticky, paint-chipped, slow-moving mechanical rides out front of your typical beat-down grocery store. <br>",

Have we reached the grim point where authoritarian governments use extensive surveillance techniques in order to determine what individuals think? Do we already have what used to be called the \u2018thought police\u2019 and now is referred to as Five-Eyes or DHS?<br /><br />In this PKD novella, crime is stopped before it can actually happen with the help of \u2018precogs\u2019 , individuals with altered / enhanced paranormal psychic powers who can take snapshots of the future. When the three mutants are on the same wavelength, they issue a majority report. If one of them dissents, there will be a minority report. Which one is more important? The opinion of the majority or that of the minority? What about when the report refers directly, personally to yourself?<br /><br /><b> Their minds were dull, confused, lost in shadows.<br />But not the shadows of today.

What mr. Anderton doesn\u2019t realize yet is that his celebrated trio of mutants have released a new report which accuses him of killing a person he doesn\u2019t even know.<br />John Anderton becomes a fugitive, desperately trying to prove his innocence while suspecting every person that surrounds him.<br /><br /><b> Did a covert awareness pass between them?

It\u2019s not paranoia if They are actually out to get you, and John Anderton is a great choice for lead character to illustrate this staple of PKD anxiety. His struggles between ideology and personal liberty echo our own struggles in the third millennium to preserve our privacy and our civil liberties in the face of government and private enterprise over-reach.<br /><br /><b> ... he was almost ready to concede that he was the victim of a weary, neurotic fantasy, spawned by growing insecurity.

As soon as precognitive information is obtained, it cancels itself out. The assertion that this man will commit a future crime is paradoxical.

    "text": "This is only my second PKD story (the first being The Man in the High Castle, which I liked, despite still being pretty sure that I don't know what any of it actually meant), and I think, maybe, that I liked this one, too... But I'm not sure yet, because, well, I had some pretty big issues with it. We shall see how I feel after I blark out all of my thoughts in this review. <br><br>The premise here is that at some point in the future, society is virtually crime-free thanks to precognitive predictions leading to pre-offense arrests. Doesn't it just make you all warm and fuzzy inside? Doesn't it make you feel all safe and sound? It sure did to Police Commissioner Anderton... at least until his name came up as a potential murderer. He goes on the run (shocker) and tries to figure out what to do next, as he's convinced that there's a plot being perpetrated against him. Dun dun dunnnnn!<br><br>So, basically, here's the deal. I like this story (mostly - there were some illogical conclusions and some plot holes that took it down a bit) if I view it superficially as a SF/dystopian thriller. But the problem is that if I look even a little bit deeper to the implications of what such a society would be like, my enjoyment falls apart and this little story really bothers me. <br><br>A word of warning here: I don't know if I can avoid spoilers if I'm going to talk about the things that bothered me about this one. So if you're concerned and don't want to be spoiled, come back in an hour after you've read the story for yourself. <br><br>So let the ramble-ranting commence. <br><br>Anderton created and built the Precrime division of the police, and he's run the show there for years. There are three precogs who were taken in early childhood and trained to search their visions of the near future for crimes, report these crimes through the computers that they are hooked up to (which analyze every sound they make), non-stop, on and on and on until they die. They are described as \"idiots\" and \"monkeys\" and \"mutants\" and are treated as tools rather than the humans they are. They are kept in the room of the police building lovingly (being SO facetious here, if you can't tell) referred to as the \"monkey room\". <blockquote>All day long the idiots babbled, imprisoned in their special high-backed chairs, held in one rigid position by metal bands, and bundles of wiring, clamps. Their physical needs were taken care of automatically. They had no spiritual needs. Vegetable-like, they muttered and dozed and existed. Their minds were dull, confused, lost in shadows. <br>But not the shadows of today. The three gibbering, fumbling creatures, with their enlarged heads and wasted bodies, were contemplating the future. The analytical machinery was recording prophecies, and as the three precog idiots talked, the machinery carefully listened.<br>For the first time Witwer's face lost its breezy confidence. A sick, dismayed expression crept into his eyes, a mixture of shame and moral shock. \"It's not -- pleasant,\" he murmured. \"I didn't realize they were so --\" He groped in his mind for the right word, gesticulating. \"So -- deformed.\" <br>\"Deformed and retarded,\" Anderton instantly agreed. \"Especially the girl, there. Donna is forty-five years old. But she looks about ten. The talent absorbs everything; the esp-lobe shrivels the balance of the frontal area. But what do we care? We get their prophecies. They pass on what we need. They don't understand any of it, but <i>we</i> do.\"</blockquote><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1407789861ra/10765869.gif\" width=\"300\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>So lemme give you the quick and dirty total spoiler version of the rest of the plot: <br>Anderton's name pops out the machine claiming that he's going to commit a murder, which is grounds for him to be arrested and detained (for a week? a month? indefinitely? Dunno. It never said...) with the other potential criminals for the safety of his potential victim. He knows he's fucked at this point, because every card that comes out to his office is duplicated to the office of the Army - you know, keep everyone honest and all that jazz. <br><br>But HE knows himself and he knows that HE would never kill anyone, so he must be being framed! (Because HE'S not a criminal like those... those... CRIMINALS. Or well, like they would be if they weren't in jail for thinking about being criminals!)<br><br>Anyway, Anderton automatically latches on to the idea that Witwer (who is newly appointed to be Anderton's assistant) is gunning for his job as head honcho... and look, his wife is there too. She's in on it! They been bangin' for weeks, that whore and her young boyfriend Witwer! They want him out of the way! Oh, no? Just in his imagination? Well, can't put nothing past a woman. Anderton don't trust nothin' that can bleed for a week and not die. Just sayin'. <br><br>So, he takes his paranoia out into the world, and starts packing, intent on going on the run. Except he's picked up and taken to his victim's house, where he tries, unsuccessfully, to convince him he means no harm. Or maybe successfully, but the victim is not in the 'giving a shit' kind of mood. So he packs him off to have him arrested, at which time he's picked up by yet ANOTHER interested party, who gives him money and fake documents and tells him to lay low. <br><br>So Anderton totally does just that, by calling his office and arranging to come scope the machinery, and telling his former employee all about his new disguise... you know, so he'll know who to expect when he gets there. Because, you see, he got a tip that there's something wonky with a minority report. What's that, you ask? Well lemme tell you! You see, the precogs are all hooked up to their own computers, and all three of them view the future individually, not together. Since there are three of them, if two agree on a potential future, that's called a majority report, and the third's differing view would be a minority report. <br><br>So, he goes, investigates, some shit goes down, and the long story short version is that, yes, there was a majority report about him killing his victim, but technically not really because they were all minority reports. <br><br>Here's how it happened. <br>1 - Supposedly at some point, he decides to kill a person. <br>2 - Anderton's name gets kicked out on a card. <br>3 - He changes his mind based on the fact that he knows he'd never kill, so the second precog picks up this change and boots out a report saying he's NOT going to kill anyone. <br>4 - He then sees THAT report and realizes that if word gets out that the precogs are false-predicting, it would shut down the Precrime division - because that would mean that they are totally imprisoning innocent people (not to be confused with 'people who just haven't committed a crime... yet') - and everything he had worked for would be gone...<br>5 - So he decides that he has to kill the guy to fulfill the original prediction to make the system not wrong and to keep the whole thing going. Which the 3rd precog picks up as intent to murder, thus forming the original majority report, even though it was two different murder decisions. <br><br>So he does the murderizing, and then goes on vacation - whoops, I mean into exile - with his wife because hey, looks like she totally wasn't a backstabbing slutwhore out to ruin him after all. Ahh, love. Such a beautiful thing. I see this relationship going the distance, I really do. <br><br>And the Precrime project lives on, though with Witwer heading it up now. Anderton parts ways with him with a warning, that Witwer should watch his back, because the situation that happened to him could only happen to the person in charge of Precrime... Do I smell a sequel?? <br><br>My question is - What in the world makes Anderton, or Witwer, or anyone in the role of the commissioner of Precrime so special? The situation occurred because someone whose name came up on a card then saw the card and thus changed their 'destiny' for lack of a better word. Why wouldn't that be possible with the clerk that Anderton handed the cards off to? What if HIS name was on a card and he saw it? Same deal. <br><br>So, at this point, you're probably asking yourself just what my problem is. Sounds like a good book, full of paradoxes and intriguing questions about the nature of inevitability and free will... I must be a terrible person for not loving it!<br><br>*sigh* You're probably right. I'm often a terrible person who dislikes books. But you see, I feel like good SF should have more than a sci-fi-y setting or situation. I feel like it should be a little more than that, and have meaning. <br><br>This one. Well. I'll just put it out there. I think if you open the door on controversial issues, you damn well better be willing to take a good look at them. And that's where this book failed for me. Not only did it not examine any social implications of the ideas he wrote about, but I feel like it outright promotes certain conceptions and attitudes that I have serious fucking issues with. <br><br>There was no examination of the morality or ethics of imprisoning people for things they haven't done. <br><br>There was no examination of the morality or ethics of imprisoning (PKD's word, remember) mentally disabled people as slaves to a morally questionable practice of imprisoning people prior to their having committed any crime. <br><br>The ONE woman in the book was portrayed alternatively as an untrustworthy whore or a loyal wife. Apparently, there was no middleground. <br><br>Maybe that's just a reflection of the difference a few decades can make in terms of mindset. But I think that if a story is going to be considered a classic, it should stand the test of time and appeal just as much to someone reading it 100 or 200 years later as it does to someone reading it the day its published. And I don't think that this one does that, because of the fact that it ignores the societal impact aspect of the story. I'm not going to cut PKD any slack for that.<br><br>I feel like there should have been MORE to this story. As it is, it's an OK thriller... but only if you don't look too close. ",

I honestly don't get how to like this novel, aside from the premise.<br /><br />The blurb/synopsis is very ambiguous, yet that's not my problem with this one. Ambiguity doesn't necessarily mean that the novel's going to turn out awful, but rather ambiguity, in most cases, leads to the enjoyment of the reader.

I honestly only liked the first story, and the others were boring and flat. I needed to force myself to read and read hoping to be able to enjoy myself, but after every short story the level of my boredom drastically increased. <br /><br />Maybe this novel's just not for me, or maybe I'm just not used to PKD's writing as this is my very first time to try out one of his novels. I'm not giving up on him though, because I think judging the author based on his short stories would be slightly incorrect. I'm clearly not recommending this, but if you're fond of PKD then maybe you'd be able to enjoy this. 1.5/5 stars, clearly not for me.",

    "text": "What I should like to know is why Anderton would have committed murder in the timeline which the first minority report forecasted. All the reasons that Anderton could have committed murders had resulted from prediction itself and there was no way that a prediction could be made without Anderton seeing the card.<br /><br />I think the story really works because no one, who already hasn't committed or is planning to commit a murder, believes him/herself capable of one. Anderton, like most such people, just can't see himself as a murderer. <br /><br />The moral issue is whether you can punish him. Orwell was against punishing thoughtcrime, though it seems to have become a crime in most countries these days. PKD goes a step further and asks whether a person who hasn't yet even thought of crime can be punished. Personally I think not, because almost all of us are potentional murderers. <br /><br />You might not agree, people are suspiciously confident of their innocence - and one almost smells a cognitive response in the way most people develop a hatred of murderers as if they are some sort of alien forces. People tend to say stuff like their souls are tainted, that they are marked like Cain etc. I should like to a dress this prejudice. The truth is murderers aren't much different from the rest of the world, and anybody can be a murderer, given adequate circumstances. Nothing is easier and, believe me, you do not feel tainted or marked. Think of soldiers or executioners or police - they aren't much different, they are just given the right circumstances. Most people just don't get fitting circumstances in their lives. Now some of you might find such a world where everybody is potential murderer interesting, the truth is despite such noise built around the thing, the actual act is disappointingly banal. I mean slipping a cyanide pill in someone's drink is not unlike slipping a medicine in drink of a patient stubbornly resisting treatment. Similarly butchering someine's neck is not unlike skinning a dead animal. It is just those children tales that make it sound like such a big deal.",

    "text": "<br />This classic Philip K. Dick tale, first published in <i>Fantastic Universe</i> (January 1956), is a richly rewarding work, at once an absorbing mystery, a nail-biting thriller, an exploration of a plausible social application of of precognitive abilities, a prescient glimpse into the coming surveillance state, a meditation on free will, and a wise assessment of the limits human character\u2014all wrapped up with an honest and satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Dick\u2019s long short story\u2014almost novella length\u2014is set in a future America that boasts a system of predictive policing called \u201cPrecrime\u201d in which three precognitive mutants (otherwise congenital, unemployable isolates) look into the future, foreseeing crimes before they happen and thus enabling the authorities to arrest and exile the potential criminals before they become felons in fact.<br /><br />But is such a system foolproof? What if, for example, there is a \u201cminority report,\u201d that is, what if one of the three mutants predicts a result that differs from the other two? What happens then? This question becomes personal for Police Commissioner John A. Anderton\u2014a firm believer in the value of the Precrime system\u2014when it predicts that he himself is destined to commit a murder. His attempt to save himself\u2014and solve the dilemma and save the Pre-Crime system too\u2014makes up the rest of the story.<br /><br />One final note. Without giving anything away, I\u2019d just like to say that the conclusion of the fine Spielberg movie differs from the book, and I believe it is inferior to Dick\u2019s original conception. It transforms Anderton into a much simpler Hollywood-type characters\u2014a servant of the system who sees the error of his ways and becomes a hero because of it. Dick\u2019s Anderton is a much more conflicted, complex character, and his decisions\u2014and their consequences\u2014are both more tragic and more believable because of it.",

I was horribly wrong.<br /><br />First of all, this was so fucking boring that I stopped reading TWO PAGES FROM THE END. It was so terribly dull that by the time I got to page 18, the number of fucks I gave had actually dipped into the negative range and I just could not continue.<br /><br />I'd like to keep this short, so I'll list the things that sucked about this story:<br /><br />- <b>20 pages seems simultaneously too long and too short. </b>Too short because there's no time for anything but plot. No characterisation or actual writing style to be seen. Too long because it was soul-numbingly, dreadfully boring.<br /><br />- <b>All of the characters were basically the same person. </b>Witwer, Anderton, Lisa, even Page and Kaplan are all just Gary Stus and Mary Sues. They're so homogenised, in fact, that when two characters talk to each other, it reads like somebody talking to their clone.<br /><br />- <b>The concept of the minority report. </b>Anderton brings up being the Police Commissioner for thirty-something years at every turn, but how in hell is it possible that he doesn't know what a minority report is?!<br /><br />- <b>For some reason, every time Anderton's wife, Lisa, shows up, her slimness always has to be brought up.</b> It was weird and annoying.<br /><br />To be honest, three words saved this story from getting a solitary star. Because in The Minority Report was the single greatest phrase for \"made a mistake\" that I've ever read: <b>\"pulled a flub.\"</b> That one had me laughing for at least five minutes.<br /><br />So it's possible that the ending of this story is totally mind-blowing and fantastic, but even if that was the case it couldn't excuse the shitty buildup to it.

    "text": "Clever and original as always, but he really did rush them sometimes. This quickfire style is fine for sci-fi short stories, as PKD showed us many times with classics like Second Variety. But this could have just done with an extra 30 to 50 more pages of relatively neutral descriptive padding, just to slow the whole thing down a bit and stop me from coming away feeling like every character other than the hero was a kind of 2 dimenionsal useful idiot, simply used as a peg to hold up the rough presentation of an idea. It's the length that's the problem, it reads like a long short story that wants to be a more suspenseful, fleshed out novella.. I feel that the philosophical implications behind the presented technology demand a more measured, maturely written piece. I appreciate that back at these times he was publishing in sci-fi mags which probably had allotted space not much better than the back of a cereal box but still.. <br />There are also some discrepancies- army convention where all the soldiers are scared and confused by the sight of someone being shot? The idea that this strange malfunction of the 'pre-cogs' could only happen to the chief of the department because they would be the only ones with pre-knowledge of the pre-cognition is flawed too- any normal citizen bring first approached by police and informed they were under arrest for a future crime would potentially change their course of behaviour if they managed to be freed or escaped.<br />When PKD did write longer fiction, it tended to be imbued with a real melancholic dreamy quality which personally I love, but might have gotten a bit predictable if he did it with everything. In the world of 21st century literature it would be nice to see more of an accepted culture of simply rewriting other people's books under modern authorship, in the spirit of a musical 'cover'. Just make that anything over 50 years old is fair game as long as you give credit, who cares? I'm not talking about a subtle, self conscious homage, just rewrite the bloody thing properly. This argument has particular weight in sci-fi, as technological concepts are at risk of getting 'bagged up' by dead writers, leaving current authors scared to encroach and being forced into more obscure and implausible terrain. And prolific 'ideas men' like Dick and Stanislav Lem have sure done a lot of bagging.",

    "text": "<i>\u201c\u2018[\u2026] To repeat: The Precrime Agency of the Federal Westbloc Government is in the process of locating and neutralizing its former Commissioner, John Allison Anderton, who, through the methodology of the precrime system, is hereby declared a potential murderer and as such forfeits his rights to freedom and all its privileges.\u2019\u201d</i><br /><br />Even though, generally, it is quite gratifying to know that other people see a lot of potential in ourselves, John Anderton is not too delighted at finding himself labelled as having <i>murderous</i> potential in him \u2013 or is he, after all? Admittedly, he is in a very awkward position because while other people were trying to use the ability of precogs to strike home on the stock market, Anderton thought it much more noble to tap the precogs\u2019 ability with a view to the common good, i.e. by using the precogs in order to forestall crimes, like murder, thereby making society a much safer place and eradicating crime completely. In order to achieve this, he selected three precogs \u2013 in the wake of the nuclear war that has taken place, a certain part of the population born after the beginning of the war has developed precognitive abilities \u2013, deformed human beings who are rendered autistic because of their special skill and who are referred to as \u201cmonkeys\u201d, and has started to collect their predictions on murders and other crimes about to be committed. In general, all three \u201cmonkeys\u201d give him the same data, but sometimes, one of them will differ in his prediction, delivering a so-called \u201cminority report\u201d. Of course, this procedure begs two obvious questions, and here is the first, most obvious one: If there can be a minority report, how much reliance may be placed on any particular prediction made by a precog? Suppose one Precog A were frequently to dissent from his fellow-precogs and generally prove wrong \u2013 this would cast a shadow of doubt on his reliability. If in his dissent, however, he proved right \u2013 would this merely cast doubt on Precogs B and C or on the whole system? And what would the ratio of minority reports be, if Anderton not only employed three, but thirty or three hundred precogs? What at first sight might look like a merely academic question quickly becomes one about the trust we can put in prognostics and scientific models: Is being right or wrong in one\u2019s prognoses a matter of consensus at all? Just consider if Precog A held his ground with his prediction over Precogs B to Z\u2019\u2019\u2019? If this happened only once, would this not discredit the system of, let\u2019s say, Precrime in that in such a case a human being would be made to suffer for a crime they would never have committed in the first place? It would be wise to bear this in mind whenever we are called upon to remodel our ways of running things on the basis of scientific prognoses.<br /><br />The second question is even more obvious than the most obvious first question, and it is purely philosophical: Can it be right to detain someone on the grounds that he <i>may</i> commit a certain crime, or should we not rather argue that the punishment ought to be as potential as the crime itself? And what would that mean? I suppose there would be hardly anyone who wouldn\u2019t agree that Dick is describing a dystopian society in his short story <i>The Minority Report</i>, because after all the idea of forfeiting your liberty and basic civil rights on account of the mere prediction that you are going to commit a crime sounds presumptuous and preposterous to most of us. Nevertheless, even without Precrime, we are more and more in a position in which we have to ask the elementary question of how much risk propensity can be demanded of a society for the sake of maintaining individual rights, privacy and personal responsibility. How much surveillance can be justified, how deeply can authorities pry into our private lives, in a fight against crime, for instance? Or when exactly is it justified to enforce a lookdown on an entire society, with the writing of a pandemic threat looming on the wall?<br /><br />In Dick\u2019s short story, Anderton, after initially making an attempt to save his own skin \u2013 and suddenly realizing the importance of the rights of the \u201cinnocent\u201d individual \u2013 proves a true adherent to the system he created and thinks that the hair of the dog is the best cure. He can finally interpret the data provided by his precogs in a way that allows him to keep his trust in the system as such, by entering into dubious horse trading activities. This downbeat ending is far superior to the one chosen by Steven Spielberg in his movie adaptation of Dick\u2019s story, where we eventually see Anderton become a convinced opponent to his own Precrime system. Such a development may be more desirable, but it is infinitely less probable because most of us are far more ready to interpret data in a way that fits in with our habits of viewing things and our basic values than we are to reconsider them from scratch and face the possibility that we may have been wrong on central questions for most of our lives. Paradoxically, we can always call this escape mechanism \u201cresponsibility\u201d and \u201csense of realism\u201d and feel eminently virtuous when making use of it.<br />",

Dick</em> but this is the first book of his that I actually got to read. In one of my classes he was the main topic too often for me not to find something of his. I kind of expected that the hype would be bigger than the actual greatness of Dick's works. But I'll be the first one to admit my mistake.<br /><br />I actually liked <strong>The Minority Report</strong> so much, that I chose the movie as my exam topic. The movie and the book are extremely different. Aside from the very basic idea of Precrime, most of what happens in the two is so different. That's why I can't judge them in comparison to one another. The movie was nice because Spielberg is a great director. Everything inside the frame in that movie is so carefully chosen that it's art.<br /><br />The book is much more wonderful in terms of the story. Shorter, of course, but a much bigger challenge when it comes to analyzing it. I've been thinking about predestination and self-fulfilling prophecies ever since I finished it and I still can't decide if the ending was just meant to be or a choice which really could have been influenced. I think the same topic is very much black and white in Greek mythology, the \"motherland\" so to say, of self-fulfilling prophecies. In this book Dick puts a lot more effort if not to answer, but to make US answer for ourselves whether free will exists at all or not.<br /><br />Overall I still don't have a full picture of his writing, though. <strong>The Minority Report</strong> is interesting and very clever and Philip K. Dick's\u00a0creativity is undoubted, but I can't say it keeps you on the edge. Therefore, I think I need to read at least one more of his works, preferably an actual book, to decide what I think of him as a writer.<br /><br /><strong>Do I recommend this?</strong> Yes.<br /><strong>Do I recommend the movie?</strong> Also yes. Much different, more suspenseful, more thought-through, I guess, in terms of a back story, good, but in another way than the book.",

    "text": "This story is difficult to review. On many levels, I really enjoyed it, despite its flaws.<br /><br />1) It got right what the movie got incredibly wrong.<br /><br />Namely, that in any story with a character knowing the future (specifically his own) there needs to be the feeling of inevitability. That all events are unavoidable, even when actively avoided. If the outcome foretold is to come true in the story, then the protagonist needs to do everything in his power to make sure it doesn't happen. <br /><br />And the easiest way to prevent a murder from happening is to not go to the building where the guy lives at the date and time you're supposed to kill him.<br /><br />This is the problem with Spielberg's version.<br /><br />There never is any reason for Anderton to kill his intended target. Nor is there ever any reason for him to meet this man at the date and time, other than the protagonist's own morbid curiosity. He goes to meet him out of a choice that seems preposterous, finds a whole bunch of reasons to kill the man, and still doesn't. When he refuses to kill the man, the man essentially kills himself, and the whole precognition aspect of the story seems incredibly contrived.<br /><br />The movie completely missed the point of the short story.<br /><br />The short story nails the circuitous nature of fortune telling, precognition, and inevitability.<br /><br />2) The problem I have with the short story is not the story itself, rather it is the writing. <br /><br />It is wooden. The characters are flat. The dialogue is stilted. There is a comical overuse of adverbs (Yes, I'm being nitpicky here, but there's misused modifiers that make the \"approach\" seem breathless rather than the character running).<br /><br />At certain parts of the story I couldn't help but picture Sharon Stone and Arnold Schwarzenegger from the 1990 film TOTAL RECALL as Anderton and his wife. There seems to be as much chemistry, and how quickly they go and forth between being lovers and enemies.<br /><br />All the characters feel like pawns used to move the plot forward, but none more so than Anderton's wife. (Probably why her part was entirely changed for the movie version).<br /><br />3) There's also a rather large plothole in who is helping Anderton and who isn't. There are several factions hunting and helping Anderton.<br /><br />Early in the story one group that helps him and causes the death of a few of his captors, is later revealed to have been on the same side as those captors. <br /><br />WHAT?! <br /><br />And your \"boss\" was totally cool with your plan to take out some of his own employees for no reason, other than making a chapter end with a cliffhanger? <br /><br />4) I smiled a couple times, knowing that Philip K. Dick was paranoid and delusional in his later years. Something about that fact, makes the read of this short story all the more enjoyable.<br /><br />Everybody is out to get Anderton and he doesn't know who to trust. <br /><br />Was it all a setup?<br />Did they want his job?<br />Was his wife in on it?<br />Was his best friend?<br /><br />In a way, the glaring plothole is more a reflection of Philip K Dick's own paranoia. Logic doesn't matter -- they're all out to get me!<br /><br />I did thoroughly enjoy this short story, although it took me several times revisiting it, just to slog throught he dialogue in the opening chapter. <br /><br />",

    "text": "My, what an interesting book! Quick read, good plot, interesting but slightly 2 dimensional characters. Not much like the movie, which is just fine. <br /><br />Something I thought was cool - there really isn't a protagonist in this novel. Everyone is out for their own personal gain. Anderton doesn't want to lose his position or Precrime. Witwer wants Anderton's job. Kaplan wants the Army back in control instead of the government. <br /><br />We're set up to think Anderton is the protagonist because he's the one being sought after for a possible murder. But when he finds out that there really is no minority report, that the precogs' reports cancel each other out instead of having a majority report, he still doesn't seem to be remorseful for any of the people that he has put into the internment camps throughout his years in Precrime. When someone suggests to him that Precrime should instead let the accused future muderer know about his/her possible crime to see if he or she changes his or her mind, he's very blaise about it. The only reason the precogs' reports change is because Anderton knows that he's being accused of a future murder to which he believes he won't commit but then after realizing why he might commit murder he changes his mind.<br /><br />This is definitely a anti-uptopian book (from Wikipedia: As in George Orwell's 1984, a dystopia does not pretend to be utopian, while an anti-utopia appears to be utopian or was intended to be so, but a fatal flaw or other factor has destroyed or twisted the intended utopian world or concept). No one comes right out and says the government and the Army is controlling the minds of the citizens, but at the end we see how everyone readily accepts whatever Kaplan says. I think Anderton's wife is the only one that brings up the subject of free will although she doesn't actually say free will.<br /><br />Very good read. ",

The 1st precog gives the preconceived report that a person is going to murder someone. So the 2nd precog is important to check the 1st precog's report with it's own report.
